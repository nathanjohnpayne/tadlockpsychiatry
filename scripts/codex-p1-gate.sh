# scripts/codex-p1-gate.sh — Codex P1 unresolved-thread merge gate
#
# Reports "Codex P1 unresolved: N" for a pull request and fails (exit 1)
# when N > 0. Read-only. Never merges, labels, or comments.
#
# Context: per nathanjohnpayne/mergepath#235, the 2026-05-13 sweep of
# unresolved reviewer feedback (#234) found 62 Codex P1 items sitting
# on merged PRs across 9 repos. P1 is Codex's "blocking" severity tag;
# 62 P1s riding through to closed state is evidence that the label was
# advisory, not enforced. This script is the v1 enforcement.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/codex-p1-gate.sh <PR_NUMBER> [REPO]
#   scripts/codex-p1-gate.sh                       # env-only mode
#
# Arguments:
#   PR_NUMBER  Required (positional or via $PR_NUMBER env). Integer.
#   REPO       Optional. "owner/repo". Falls back to $REPO env, then
#              to the current repo via `gh repo view`.
#
# Environment:
#   GH_TOKEN   Required. Needs pull_requests:read.
#   PR_NUMBER  Optional fallback for the positional arg. The
#              scheduled-sweep job in .github/workflows/codex-p1-
#              gate.yml passes PR_NUMBER positionally per iteration,
#              but other callers (workflow_dispatch, ad-hoc CLI use,
#              CI matrix jobs) may find it easier to set it as env.
#   REPO       Optional fallback for the positional REPO arg. Same
#              motivation as PR_NUMBER above.
#
# Algorithm:
#   1. Read .github/review-policy.yml `codex.p1_gate.enabled`. If false
#      (the default everywhere except mergepath), exit 0 — clean pass,
#      gate disabled.
#   2. Fetch all inline review comments on the PR via
#      `repos/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments`.
#   3. Filter to comments authored by `chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`
#      (or whatever `codex.bot_login` is configured to) that contain a
#      P1 marker — the badge image pattern `![P1 Badge]` or the text
#      pattern `**P1` (covers Codex's text-only fallback when image
#      rendering is suppressed).
#   4. For each candidate, fetch its review thread state via GraphQL
#      `reviewThreads` and check `isResolved`. The author or any
#      collaborator can resolve a thread via the GitHub UI or
#      `resolveReviewThread` mutation; this script does NOT fight
#      against a human-or-agent-marked-resolved state.
#   5. SHA scope: a P1 finding only gates if its comment was attached
#      to the PR's current HEAD. A P1 from an earlier SHA that is now
#      either resolved OR no longer on HEAD does not count.
#   6. Print one line per unresolved P1 to stdout for CI visibility,
#      then the summary "Codex P1 unresolved: N".
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   No unresolved P1s on current HEAD (or gate disabled).
#   1   One or more unresolved P1s on current HEAD — gate blocks.
#   2   Usage / config error. Error message on stderr.
#
# Design notes:
#   - Read-only. Only GETs against the GitHub API.
#   - bash 3.2 portable (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`, no associative arrays
#     or [[ ]] regex features beyond what 3.2 supports).
#   - PATH-shimmable: tests substitute a `gh` stub on PATH that returns
#     canned payloads. See tests/test_codex_p1_gate.sh.
#   - The override pattern from #235 (`p1-already-fixed`,
#     `p1-rejected`, `p1-moot`, `p1-deferred`) is NOT implemented in
#     v1 — instead, the override path is "mark the thread resolved
#     via the GitHub UI or GraphQL". The structured taxonomy lands in
#     a follow-up once we see how the basic gate behaves in practice.

#     `codex-review-check.sh` covers Codex clearance more broadly;
#     this script is a narrower per-thread enforcement that exists

#     anyway" failure mode.
