# label-removal-guard.sh — PreToolUse hook for Claude Code.
#
# Blocks `gh pr edit ... --remove-label <label>` calls (and the
# add-label inverse for the same labels) for the human-action labels
# defined in REVIEW_POLICY.md § Agent prohibitions:
#
#   - needs-external-review
#   - needs-human-review
#   - policy-violation
#
# Rationale: agents must never remove these labels, even when a human
# authorizes it in chat. One-time chat authorization does not extrapolate
# into standing permission. The sanctioned path is
# `scripts/request-label-removal.sh <PR#> <label>`, which posts a
# templated ask + optional iMessage ping, after which the human clears
# the label from any device.
#
# This hook is mechanism enforcement — it makes the doctrinal rule
# unbreakable regardless of whether the agent read the policy doc.
#
# Scope: this hook applies ONLY to `Bash` tool calls from interactive
# agent sessions (claude / cursor / codex). It does NOT and SHOULD NOT
# apply to `gh` calls executed inside GitHub Actions workflows — those
# run in the CI runner's environment, not under an agent's PreToolUse
# surface. Per the REVIEW_POLICY.md § Agent prohibitions sanctioned-
# automation exception (#191/#195), the `auto-clear-blocking-labels.yml`
# workflow is the only sanctioned automated path for
# needs-external-review removal; this hook does not interfere with it.
#
# Architecture: same shape as scripts/hooks/gh-pr-guard.sh — read the
# Bash command from stdin (Claude Code passes JSON via stdin to
# PreToolUse hooks), tokenize with shlex (quote-aware), walk to find
# `gh ... pr edit`, then scan the edit subcommand's flags for
# --remove-label / --add-label whose value matches the prohibited set.
#
# A break-glass override is intentionally NOT provided. If a human
# genuinely needs the agent to act on the label, they remove it
# themselves; the agent can re-trigger merge after.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = allow
#   2 = block (hard stop)

# Cheap pre-check: if the command isn't `gh pr edit`, skip the tokenize

# label name as a substring — Codex P1 on PR #172 caught that the
# substring gate is bypassable when the label value is supplied via
# shell expansion (`--remove-label "$VAR"`) or ANSI-C quoting
# (`--remove-label $'needs-human-review'`). The token-walk below sees
# the EXPANDED value (because the harness passes the literal command
# string the agent intends to run) — which means the post-tokenize
# regex check is the source of truth, and any pre-check on label name
# would either let bypasses through (bug) or false-positive on
# unrelated commands. The `gh pr edit` form check is structural (the
# binary name + subcommand must be literal for the command to do
# anything), so it remains safe.

# Scan tokens AFTER `edit` for --remove-label or --add-label values.
# Both forms are blocked: removing a label bypasses human gating;
# adding one (e.g. spuriously re-applying policy-violation) is also a
# human action.
#
# Two block triggers:
#   1. Literal value matches the prohibited set.
#   2. Value undergoes shell expansion (contains $, backtick, or starts
#      with $') — Codex P1 on PR #172. The hook receives the literal
#      command string before bash expands variables, so a value like
#      `--remove-label "$VAR"` would tokenize as the literal `$VAR`
#      and slip past a value-only regex check, even though the bash
#      that actually runs the command would expand it to a prohibited
#      label. Block any expansion-bearing value with a message
#      directing the agent to use a literal label name (so the hook
#      can see what's being modified) or scripts/request-label-removal.sh.

BLOCKED: agents must not modify the '$label' label on PRs.

Per REVIEW_POLICY.md § Agent prohibitions, the labels:
  - needs-external-review
  - needs-human-review
  - policy-violation
are HUMAN-ACTION labels. One-time chat authorization does not extend to
agent action on these labels.

If the PR is otherwise green and only this label is blocking merge:
  scripts/request-label-removal.sh <PR#> $label

That helper posts a templated ask on the PR (and optionally iMessages
the human). The human clears the label from any device; auto-merge
fires immediately.

block_expansion() {
  local val="$1"
  cat <<EOF >&2
BLOCKED: --add-label / --remove-label value '$val' contains shell
expansion (\$, backtick, or \$'…' quoting). The hook can't see what
this expands to until bash runs the command — so it cannot verify the
label isn't one of the prohibited set (needs-external-review,
needs-human-review, policy-violation).

Use a literal label name so the guard can verify it, OR — if you
intended to remove a prohibited label — run:
  scripts/request-label-removal.sh <PR#> <label>

See REVIEW_POLICY.md § Agent prohibitions.
