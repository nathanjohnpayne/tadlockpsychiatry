# gh-pr-guard.sh — PreToolUse hook for Claude Code
#
# Gates four operations:
#   1. gh pr create — blocks unless (a) the keyring's active gh
#      account is the AUTHOR identity (nathanjohnpayne by default;
#      override via GH_PR_GUARD_EXPECTED_AUTHOR), AND (b) the command
#      text includes "Authoring-Agent:" and "## Self-Review". The
#      identity check (#241) prevents the split-invocation footgun
#      where a `gh auth switch` in one Bash tool call drifts before
#      the `gh pr create` in a subsequent call, landing the PR under
#      the wrong account. Canonical fix is to use
#      scripts/gh-as-author.sh which wraps switch + create + switch-
#      back in one bash process.
#   2. gh pr merge --admin — blocks unless BREAK_GLASS_ADMIN=1
#      (human must explicitly authorize in chat)
#   3. gh pr merge (any flavor) — blocks when the target PR's
#      `mergeStateStatus` is BLOCKED / DIRTY / UNSTABLE / BEHIND /
#      DRAFT (or any unrecognized future value) unless
#      BREAK_GLASS_MERGE_STATE=1. This is the defense-in-depth
#      layer behind GitHub branch protection — see #170 / #171 for
#      the merge-gate gap this closes (a PR can otherwise be merged
#      with failing CI because nothing in the merge path actually
#      blocks). Originated downstream (matchline #170/#171) and is
#      unified into the canonical hook here so propagation no longer
#      clobbers the feature — see the propagation-wave retro.
#   4. gh pr merge (non-admin) — blocks when the target PR carries
#      the `needs-external-review` label unless CODEX_CLEARED=1
#      (agent must have just run scripts/codex-review-check.sh
#      successfully). This enforces REVIEW_POLICY.md § Phase 4a
#      merge gate at the hook layer so an agent can't accidentally
#      merge past Label Gate by removing the label without running
#      the gate check first.
#
# Byline-sensitive command coverage (#284):
#
#   Beyond the pr-create / pr-merge gates above, the hook ALSO
#   guards a class of commands whose byline is identity-load-bearing
#   in this codebase:
#
#     - gh pr comment <PR#> --body "..."
#     - gh pr review <PR#> --comment / --approve / --request-changes
#     - gh issue comment <issue#> --body "..."
#
#   For all three, the keyring's active account must be the agent's
#   REVIEWER identity (nathanpayne-<agent>, default nathanpayne-claude;
#   override via GH_PR_GUARD_EXPECTED_REVIEWER). Posting these as the
#   AUTHOR identity (nathanjohnpayne) breaks the audit-trail
#   convention REVIEW_POLICY.md depends on — reviewer comments must
#   attribute to the reviewer. The check fires before the keyring
#   write so misattributed comments never land.
#
#   Additionally, `gh pr review --approve` is blocked when the
#   target PR is OVER-threshold AND the keyring is the agent's own
#   reviewer identity AND the PR's body contains an `Authoring-Agent:`
#   line that names the SAME agent. This is the no-self-approve
#   policy from REVIEW_POLICY.md § No-self-approve scoping enforced
#   at the hook layer: a `claude` reviewer must not approve a PR
#   whose `Authoring-Agent: claude` line means claude wrote it. The
#   over/under-threshold determination uses .github/review-policy.yml
#   if present; without the file the hook conservatively assumes
#   over-threshold so the self-approve block fires on safer side.
#
#   These guards are scoped to `gh pr comment` / `gh pr review` /
#   `gh issue comment` exactly. Raw `gh api -X POST .../comments` is
#   intentionally NOT covered in this PR — the token/keyring auth
#   matrix for raw `gh api` writes is not yet precise enough to
#   block on without false positives. See REVIEW_POLICY.md
#   § Operation-to-Identity Matrix (graphql write — PAT-attributed)
#   for the auth-split context and the follow-up tracked under #284.
#
# The identity check (1a) honors a
# BOOTSTRAP_GH_PR_GUARD_SKIP_IDENTITY_CHECK=1 escape hatch for tests
# that PATH-shim gh and have no real keyring. Production code should
# never set this — the wrapper script gh-as-author.sh switches to the
# author identity BEFORE the gh pr create call lands, so the check
# passes naturally without the bypass.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = allow
#   2 = block (hard stop)
#
# Architecture notes:
#
#   The hook does ALL its parsing on a tokenized form of the
#   command produced by `xargs -n 1`, which honors POSIX shell
#   quoting. Earlier iterations used substring `grep` on the raw
#   command string and were buggy in two correlated ways:
#
#     1. nathanpayne-codex caught (PR #66 round 2) that
#        `TOKENS=( $COMMAND )` performed bash word splitting that
#        ignored shell quotes — `gh pr merge --body "hello world"
#        65` would split into (gh, pr, merge, --body, "hello,
#        world", 65) and confuse the value-flag SKIP logic.
#
#     2. nathanpayne-codex caught (PR #66 round 3) that the
#        top-level matcher `^\s*gh\s+pr\s+(create|merge)` only
#        recognized the bare form. gh accepts a global -R/--repo
#        flag BEFORE the subcommand: `gh -R foo/bar pr merge 65`
#        and `gh --repo foo/bar pr create ...` would bypass the
#        hook entirely.
#
#   Both bugs trace to the same shape — substring matching on a
#   string of unknown structure. The fix is to tokenize once at
#   the top with quote awareness, walk the tokens to identify the
#   pr subcommand (capturing any global -R/--repo along the way),
#   and reuse the same TOKENS array in the create and merge
#   branches.
#
# Design notes:
#
#   - The CODEX_CLEARED check is a hook-layer defense-in-depth.
#     The authoritative merge gate is scripts/codex-review-check.sh;
#     the hook only verifies the agent claims to have run it. An
#     agent that sets CODEX_CLEARED=1 without actually running the
#     check is violating policy — the hook is not an integrity
#     check, it is an ordering check.
#
#   - PR selector is parsed from the command tokens: first non-flag
#     positional argument after `merge`. Accepts <number> | <url> |
#     <branch> per the gh CLI grammar. If no selector is present,
#     the hook falls back to `gh pr view --json labels` with no
#     positional so gh resolves the PR from the current branch.
#
#   - Label lookup calls the GitHub API. This is a side effect of
#     the hook but consistent with the agent's own label-check
#     behavior elsewhere in the policy flow. Failure to reach the
#     API (offline, auth issue) fails CLOSED with a diagnostic.
#
#   - Bash 3.2 portability: macOS ships bash 3.2 by default. The
#     hook avoids bash 4+ features (no `mapfile`, no `[[ =~ ]]` in
#     places where `[[ == ]]` works, etc.).
#
# Inline environment assignments:
#
#   The bash form `VAR=value command args` sets VAR in the spawned
#   command's environment but NOT in the hook process. The PreToolUse
#   hook fires before bash executes the command, so it can't read
#   inline-prefixed env vars from its own ${VAR} expansion. The
#   documented happy paths use exactly this form:
#
#     CODEX_CLEARED=1 gh pr merge 65 --squash --delete-branch
#     BREAK_GLASS_ADMIN=1 gh pr merge --admin 65 ...
#
#   So the hook must parse env assignments out of the command string
#   before the `gh` token and treat them as if they were exported.
#   nathanpayne-codex caught the bypass on PR #66 round 4: with the
#   round-3 hook, both forms hit the early `^\s*gh(\s|$)` matcher,
#   missed it, and exited 0 before any guard ran.
#
#   Round 4 fix: the early matcher now allows leading prefix material
#   before `gh`, and the top-level token walk captures CODEX_CLEARED
#   and BREAK_GLASS_ADMIN from the pre-gh tokens into INLINE_ vars.
#   The merge guard then uses these as fallbacks if the hook's own
#   environment doesn't have the corresponding variable set via
#   `export`.
#
# Limitations (documented as known gaps):
#
#   - Backslash escapes inside double-quoted strings (`"with
#     \"escape\""`) are not handled by xargs and will fail closed
#     with the tokenization error.
#
#   - Custom gh aliases (`gh alias set merge ...`) that expand
#     `merge` to something else are not recognized — the hook
#     guards a specific literal command grammar.
#
#   - Unknown global flags (anything other than `-R/--repo` and
#     boolean flags like `--help`/`--version`) are assumed boolean.
#     If gh adds new value-taking globals, the hook needs an
#     update; misclassifying them as boolean would let the next
#     token leak through as the subcommand.
#
#   - Other env vars in the inline prefix (anything other than
#     CODEX_CLEARED and BREAK_GLASS_ADMIN) are skipped without
#     interpretation. This is fine because no other env var is
#     consulted by hook policy decisions.

# --- tokenize the command with shell-quote awareness ---
#
# Use python3 shlex.split which honors POSIX single and double
# quoting AND handles multi-line quoted strings. `gh pr merge
# --body "hello world" 65` tokenizes correctly to (gh, pr, merge,
# --body, hello world, 65), and `gh pr create --body "Authoring-
# Agent: claude\n## Self-Review\nok"` (with literal newlines in
# the body) also tokenizes correctly because shlex.split treats
# newlines inside quotes as literal characters, not as token
# separators.
#
# Earlier versions used `xargs -n 1` (with the implicit `echo`
# command), which:
#   - Silently drops -n / -e / -E (echo's own flags). Codex caught
#     this on PR #66 round 6 and the workaround was `xargs -n 1
#     printf '%s\n'`.
#   - Treats embedded newlines as token separators, breaking
#     valid `gh pr create --body "...multiline..."` invocations.
#     Codex caught this on nathanpaynedotcom propagation PR #180
#     round 4. xargs has no flag to disable this behavior; the
#     fix is to switch tokenizers entirely.
#
# python3 is available on macOS 12+ by default and on every Linux
# distro the agent flow runs on. Python startup cost is ~50ms per
# invocation; acceptable for a hook that already does an API call.
#
# Fails CLOSED on tokenization error (unmatched quote, bad escape).
# An agent should fix the malformed command and retry.
#
# python3 emits tokens NUL-delimited so bash's read -d '' can
# preserve embedded newlines. The output goes via a tempfile
# rather than $(...) command substitution because bash command
# substitution silently strips NUL bytes from its capture buffer,
# which would re-jam all tokens together. Earlier versions used
# newline-delimited output via print(tok), which silently SPLIT
# any token containing a literal newline (e.g., the body of a
# `gh pr create --body "Authoring-Agent: claude\n## Self-Review
# \nok"`) into multiple bash tokens. Codex caught the bash-side
# split on nathanpaynedotcom propagation PR #180 round 5.

# consume their next token as the value. An earlier round used
# `grep -q -- --admin` on the raw command string for the admin
# check, which over-matched any `--admin` substring inside a
# quoted flag value (e.g., `--subject "--admin follow-up"`).
# nathanpayne-codex caught that on PR #66 round 6.
#
# An even earlier version of this walk used a separate `FOUND_MERGE`
# scan that latched onto the FIRST `merge` token anywhere in the

# like `echo merge ; gh pr merge 65`, the walk would latch onto the
# echo arg and then capture `;` as the selector. Codex caught that
# on the swipewatch propagation PR #33; the fix is to use the
# PR_SUBCOMMAND_INDEX captured during phase 1 as the starting point
# of the merge walk, eliminating the FOUND_MERGE state entirely.
#
# `gh pr merge` accepts the selector as <number> | <url> | <branch>;
# we don't parse or validate the form, just pass it through to
