# verify-propagation-pr.sh — authoritative faithful-mirror check for
# the propagation-PR review lane (REVIEW_POLICY.md § Propagation PR
# review lane, mergepath#264 / #268 / #323).
#
# The lane exempts a sync PR from Phase 4 external review. That is
# only safe if the PR is PROVABLY a verbatim mirror of mergepath's
# canonical/kit content — not merely "confined to manifest-typed
# paths" (Codex P1 on #268: a mergepath-sync/* PR could otherwise
# hand-edit a workflow, which IS a manifest path, and skip review).
#
# This script is the teeth. It byte-compares every file the PR
# changes against the SAME path in a checkout of mergepath at the
# sync's source commit. It is TRUSTED ONLY when invoked from that
# mergepath checkout (the immutable, public commit the PR's branch
# name points at) — never from the PR's own checkout, which the PR
# could have tampered with.
#
# Two verification surfaces:
#
#   A. Canonical / kit entries — byte-for-byte equality against
#      mergepath@<sha>. Implemented as a `git ls-tree` mode+oid
#      compare so an exec-bit flip is also caught.
#
#   B. Templated entries (#323) — render the source template at
#      mergepath@<sha> with the consumer's facts (loaded from the
#      mergepath-side manifest via export_consumer_facts) and
#      byte-compare the rendered output against the PR's dest
#      content. Drift, template syntax errors, and missing facts in
#      strict mode all fail the verification with a typed
#      diagnostic. On pass, a structured line of the form
#      "[mergepath-verify: templated-render] <dest> <consumer> <source>"
#      is emitted on stdout so a calling workflow can post it as a
#      thread tag-reply. This script intentionally stays read-only —
#      it does NOT post to GitHub.
#
# Consumer inference (templated surface only):
#   1. $MERGEPATH_CONSUMER env override (test/CI escape hatch).
#   2. consumer_dir's `origin` remote URL → matched against the
#      manifest's .consumers[].repo field.
#   3. If neither resolves, the templated surface is SKIPPED with a
#      stderr note (the canonical/kit surface still runs). This is
#      conservative: a templated entry whose consumer can't be
#      identified is just left to the existing path-confinement
#      check, which will fail because the templated dest doesn't
#      equal the templated .path — the PR then routes to normal
#      Phase 4 review, same as the pre-#323 status quo.
#
# Usage:
#   verify-propagation-pr.sh <mergepath_dir> <consumer_dir> <base_sha> <head_sha>
#
#   mergepath_dir  a checkout of nathanjohnpayne/mergepath at the
#                  sync's source commit (the <sha> in the PR branch
#                  name mergepath-sync/[sync-all-]<sha>). Provides BOTH
#                  the authoritative manifest AND the canonical content
#                  to compare against.
#   consumer_dir   the consumer repo's PR checkout (a git work tree;
#                  base..head must be resolvable in it).
#   base_sha       PR base SHA.
#   head_sha       PR head SHA.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  faithful mirror — every changed file is under a manifest path
#      AND its end-state byte-matches mergepath@<sha> (both-present-
#      equal, or both-absent), with templated dests matching their
#      re-rendered output. The PR is lane-eligible.
#   1  NOT a faithful mirror — at least one changed file is off-
#      manifest, deviates from mergepath@<sha>, or its templated
#      re-render diverges. The PR must go through normal Phase 3/4
#      review. Deviations are listed on stderr.
#   2  usage / environment error (bad args, missing manifest, etc.).
#
# Bash 3.2 portable: no `mapfile`, no associative arrays.
