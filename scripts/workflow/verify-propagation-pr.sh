# verify-propagation-pr.sh — authoritative faithful-mirror check for
# the propagation-PR review lane (REVIEW_POLICY.md § Propagation PR
# review lane, mergepath#264 / #268 / #323).
#
# The lane exempts a sync PR from Phase 4 external review. That is
# only safe if the PR is PROVABLY a verbatim mirror of mergepath's
# canonical/kit content — not merely "confined to manifest-typed
# paths" (Codex P1 on #268: a mergepath-sync/* PR could otherwise
# hand-edit a workflow, which IS a manifest path, and skip review).
#
# This script is the teeth. It byte-compares every file the PR
# changes against the SAME path in a checkout of mergepath at the
# sync's source commit (<mergepath_dir>, used as a DATA source only).
# It is TRUSTED when invoked from a tamper-proof in-repo location:
# pr-review-policy.yml runs the consumer's OWN copy from the PR's BASE
# commit (propagated + reviewed; the PR cannot edit its base), and this
# script sources its helper scripts + libs from its own directory
# (#531). It must NOT be run from the PR's own checkout (the PR could
# tamper with it) nor executed out of the runtime-cloned mergepath@<sha>
# (a `pull-requests: write` workflow running runtime-fetched shell is an
# RCE surface).
#
# mergepath-verifier-contract: self-sourced-helpers-v1
#   pr-review-policy.yml greps the BASE-commit copy of this file for the
#   exact tag above BEFORE running it. A base verifier without the tag
#   predates the #531 self-sourcing hardening (it sources its helpers
#   from the runtime-cloned mergepath, i.e. fetched shell), so the review
#   workflow fails closed and falls through to normal review instead of
#   executing it. Keep this tag in lockstep with the self-sourcing block
#   below — if you ever revert to sourcing from the runtime clone, drop
#   the tag so no consumer treats the old shape as trusted.
#
# Two verification surfaces:
#
#   A. Canonical / kit entries — byte-for-byte equality against
#      mergepath@<sha>. Implemented as a `git ls-tree` mode+oid
#      compare so an exec-bit flip is also caught.
#
#   B. Templated entries (#323) — render the source template at
#      mergepath@<sha> with the consumer's facts (loaded from the
#      mergepath-side manifest via export_consumer_facts) and
#      byte-compare the rendered output against the PR's dest
#      content. Drift, template syntax errors, and missing facts in
#      strict mode all fail the verification with a typed
#      diagnostic. On pass, a structured line of the form
#      "[mergepath-verify: templated-render] <dest> <consumer> <source>"
#      is emitted on stdout so a calling workflow can post it as a
#      thread tag-reply. This script intentionally stays read-only —
#      it does NOT post to GitHub.
#
# Consumer inference (templated surface only):
#   1. $MERGEPATH_CONSUMER env override (test/CI escape hatch).
#   2. consumer_dir's `origin` remote URL → matched against the
#      manifest's .consumers[].repo field.
#   3. If neither resolves, the templated surface is SKIPPED with a
#      stderr note (the canonical/kit surface still runs). This is
#      conservative: a templated entry whose consumer can't be
#      identified is just left to the existing path-confinement
#      check, which will fail because the templated dest doesn't
#      equal the templated .path — the PR then routes to normal
#      Phase 4 review, same as the pre-#323 status quo.
#
# Source-commit provenance (always enforced, before any byte compare):
#   The <sha> in a sync branch name is attacker-choosable — any commit that
#   exists anywhere in the public mergepath repository, including one on an
#   unmerged branch or a fork-PR ref, can be checked out by SHA. A faithful
#   mirror of such a commit is a faithful mirror of UNREVIEWED content. So
#   <mergepath_dir> must be a git checkout whose HEAD is on the FIRST-PARENT
#   history of mergepath's default branch as recorded by the clone
#   (refs/remotes/origin/HEAD) — i.e. a tree that actually existed on the
#   default branch after mergepath's own review. Generic ancestry is not
#   enough: an intermediate commit of a PR branch merged with a true merge
#   commit is an ancestor too. When <source_sha> is passed it must be the full
#   40-hex id of that same HEAD, so the verdict is bound to the commit the
#   caller resolved from the branch name. Anything unprovable is not
#   lane-eligible.
#
# Usage:
#   verify-propagation-pr.sh <mergepath_dir> <consumer_dir> <base_sha> <head_sha> [<source_sha>]
#
#   mergepath_dir  a git checkout of nathanjohnpayne/mergepath at the
#                  sync's source commit (the <sha> in the PR branch
#                  name mergepath-sync/<sha> or
#                  mergepath-sync/sync-all-<sha>[-<scope-digest>]), with
#                  refs/remotes/origin/HEAD naming the default branch (a
#                  plain `git clone` records it). Provides BOTH the
#                  authoritative manifest AND the canonical content to
#                  compare against.
#   consumer_dir   the consumer repo's PR checkout (a git work tree;
#                  base..head must be resolvable in it).
#   base_sha       PR base SHA.
#   head_sha       PR head SHA.
#   source_sha     optional; the FULL 40-hex mergepath commit the caller
#                  resolved from the branch name. Must equal
#                  mergepath_dir's HEAD.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  faithful mirror — every changed file is under a manifest path
#      AND its end-state byte-matches mergepath@<sha> (both-present-
#      equal, or both-absent), with templated dests matching their
#      re-rendered output. The PR is lane-eligible.
#   1  NOT a faithful mirror — at least one changed file is off-
#      manifest, deviates from mergepath@<sha>, or its templated
#      re-render diverges. The PR must go through normal Phase 3/4
#      review. Deviations are listed on stderr.
#   2  usage / environment error (bad args, missing manifest,
#      mergepath_dir not a git checkout, default branch unrecorded, etc.).
#
# The source-commit provenance check exits 1 when mergepath_dir's HEAD is
# not on mergepath's default branch (a verdict: not lane-eligible) and 2
# when provenance cannot be evaluated. Every non-zero exit keeps the PR
# out of the lane.
