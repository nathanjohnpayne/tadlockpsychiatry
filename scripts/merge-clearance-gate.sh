# scripts/merge-clearance-gate.sh — HEAD-pinned merge-clearance gate
#
# Read-only required-status-check gate that fails CLOSED at merge time
# when a PR's clearance condition is not satisfied ON THE CURRENT HEAD.
# Never merges, labels, or comments.
#
# Context — nathanjohnpayne/mergepath#427 + #428. Two merge-gate escapes
# slipped past the enforcement layer and were caught only by the WEEKLY
# retroactive audit (pr-audit.yml), a week after merge:
#
#   #427 (matchline#245): a Dependabot dev-dependencies group bump merged
#        with NO reviewer-identity APPROVED review on the merge HEAD. The
#        dependabot-auto-merge.yml approval is transient — a rebase push
#        dismisses it (or it was never re-posted on the final SHA) — and a
#        human then merged the approved-but-unmerged PR. Nothing failed
#        closed.
#   #428 (nathanpaynedotcom#405): an over-threshold (needs-external-review)
#        PR merged with no APPROVED CLI review and no Codex review on the
#        merge HEAD. Clearance was evaluated on an EARLIER HEAD, the
#        removable-label proxy went stale, and the only required checks
#        (Label Gate green-but-stale, Codex P1 vacuously green) did not
#        represent clearance on the merge HEAD.
#
# Shared root cause: clearance was enforced via a MUTABLE proxy (a
# dismissable review, a removable label) plus a weekly audit — never as a
# HEAD-pinned required status check that re-evaluates on every push and
# fails closed. This script is that check. Modeled on the proven
# codex-p1-gate.sh / codex-p1-gate.yml pattern (required check +
# scheduled sweep + trusted default-branch checkout).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/merge-clearance-gate.sh [PR_NUMBER] [REPO]
#   scripts/merge-clearance-gate.sh                  # env-only mode
#
# Arguments (positional take precedence; env fallbacks support the
# scheduled-sweep / workflow_dispatch invocation shape):
#   PR_NUMBER  Required (positional or $PR_NUMBER env). Integer.
#   REPO       Optional. "owner/repo". Falls back to $REPO env, then to
#              the current repo via `gh repo view`.
#
# Environment:
#   GH_TOKEN   Required. Needs pull_requests:read (+ the read scopes
#              codex-review-check.sh needs for the external-review path).
#   MERGE_CLEARANCE_CODEX_CHECK_BIN
#              Optional. Path to codex-review-check.sh. Defaults to the
#              sibling script next to this one. Tests override it to a
#              stub so the external-review dispatch + exit-code mapping
#              can be exercised without re-deriving codex-review-check's
#              full behavior.
#
# What it enforces, by PR class (evaluated on pr.head.sha):
#
#   Dependabot PR (author == 'dependabot[bot]'):
#     Gated by `dependabot.reviewer_gate.enabled` (default false; true in
#     mergepath). When enabled, BLOCKS unless a reviewer identity in
#     `available_reviewers` (≠ PR author) has a latest-state APPROVED
#     review whose commit_id == HEAD. This is the HEAD-pinned form of
#     pr-audit.yml Check 2's Dependabot path — a transient approval
#     dismissed on a rebase push re-blocks on the new HEAD.
#
#   External-review PR:
#     Gated by `codex.external_review_gate.enabled` (default false; true
#     in mergepath). Applicability is DERIVED from the PR's intrinsic
#     properties — over `external_review_threshold` lines, OR a changed
#     file matching `external_review_paths`, OR the `needs-external-review`
#     label present — NOT from the label alone. (Trusting the label would
#     reopen the #428 stale-label race: after a push, this gate can run
#     before pr-review-policy.yml re-adds the label, and a label-only check
#     would false-clear on an uncleared HEAD. #429 Codex P1.) When it
#     applies, delegates to codex-review-check.sh — the SAME clearance
#     predicate (gate (b) reviewer APPROVED + gate (c) Codex /
#     Phase-4b-substitute on HEAD) the auto-clear workflow uses — so the
#     merge-time gate and the label-clear logic cannot drift. CI checking
#     (gate (a)) is skipped for this invocation because this gate is ITSELF
#     a required check; waiting on the full required-check rollup (which
#     includes this gate) would deadlock. CI green is enforced
#     independently by the other required checks. Verified propagation PRs
#     (trusted github-actions[bot] lane marker, label absent) are EXEMPT —
#     the pr-review-policy.yml lane already cleared them; re-deriving would
#     force them into Phase 4 and break the lane (#429 Codex round-2 P1).
#
#   Any other PR (under-threshold, non-Dependabot, or relevant knob off):
#     CLEAN PASS (exit 0). The gate is a no-op so it can be a required
#     check on every PR without blocking normal under-threshold merges.
#
# Exit codes (same contract as scripts/codex-p1-gate.sh):
#   0   Clearance satisfied (or gate not applicable / disabled).
#   1   Clearance NOT satisfied on the current HEAD — gate BLOCKS.
#   2   Usage / config / infrastructure error. Message on stderr.
#
# Design notes:
#   - Read-only. Only GETs against the GitHub API (plus a read-only
#     delegate to codex-review-check.sh on the external-review path).
#   - bash 3.2 portable; PATH-shimmable `gh` for tests (see
#     tests/test_merge_clearance_gate.sh).

# Propagation-lane exemption (#429), HEAD-PINNED. Returns 0 (true) iff a PR
# comment authored by github-actions[bot] carries the propagation-lane marker
# scoped to the CURRENT head SHA — i.e. `mergepath-propagation-lane
# verified-head=<HEAD_SHA>`. .github/workflows/pr-review-policy.yml posts that
# marker ONLY after mergepath@<sha>'s verify-propagation-pr.sh byte-confirms a
# faithful mirror AT THAT HEAD, and a PR author cannot post as
# github-actions[bot] — so it is a TRUSTED, head-scoped signal that the lane
# already exempted THIS head from external review (REVIEW_POLICY.md §
# Propagation PR review lane).
#
# Why head-pinned (Codex round-3 P1 + nathanpayne-codex CHANGES_REQUESTED on
# #429): an unscoped "was-ever-a-mirror" marker is posted once and survives a
# later divergent push. On the synchronize where this gate finishes before
# pr-review-policy.yml re-adds needs-external-review, an unscoped check would
# go GREEN on an unverified large/.github PR. Pinning the exemption to the
# current head SHA closes that race independently of label timing: a diverged
# (or merely newer-but-not-yet-verified) head has no matching marker, so the
# gate does NOT exempt it and falls through to threshold/paths derivation.
# A DIVERGED push never gets a marker at all (the lane's propagation_lane is
# false → it posts nothing for that head). A faithful re-push is briefly
# not-yet-exempt (fail-closed) until the lane posts the new head's marker and
# the next event / scheduled sweep re-evaluates.
#
# Without this exemption, deriving applicability from threshold/protected-paths
# would force verified propagation PRs — large by design, touching .github/**,
# AND carrying an `Authoring-Agent` stamp (so codex-review-check.sh's
# same-agent guard disqualifies their normal internal approval) — into Phase
# 4/Codex clearance, breaking the documented under-threshold lane.
#
# Marker contract is shared with pr-review-policy.yml — keep the
# `mergepath-propagation-lane verified-head=<sha>` form in sync.
