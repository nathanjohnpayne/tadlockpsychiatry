# resolve-pr-threads.sh — Enumerate and resolve open review threads on a PR.
#
# Branch protection on `main` typically requires
# `required_conversation_resolution: true`, which means **every review
# thread on the PR must be resolved** before `mergeStateStatus` flips
# from `BLOCKED` to `CLEAN`. This includes CodeRabbit's `🧹 Nitpick` /
# `🔵 Trivial` comments that don't block merge in CodeRabbit's own
# model but DO block the conversation-resolution gate.
#
# The blocker is invisible in `gh pr checks` output — only the GitHub
# UI surfaces it. This script fills the discoverability gap.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/resolve-pr-threads.sh <PR#> [--repo owner/name] [--list]
#                                 [--auto-resolve-bots] [--dry-run]
#
# Modes:
#   --list                  List unresolved threads with author + path +
#                           first-comment excerpt. No mutations.
#   --auto-resolve-bots     Resolve threads whose author is a bot
#                           (CodeRabbit, Codex Connector, Dependabot)
#                           AND whose latest comment is on the current
#                           HEAD. Use ONLY when:
#                           - The agent has already addressed each
#                             finding in a fix commit on this HEAD, OR
#                             posted a rebuttal reply, AND
#                           - The bot author has not auto-resolved in
#                             a reasonable window.
#                           Per REVIEW_POLICY.md § Implementation notes
#                           for branch protection gates: this is a
#                           CLEAN-UP mechanism, not a policy override.
#                           Human-authored threads are NEVER auto-
#                           resolved regardless of mode.
#   --dry-run               With --auto-resolve-bots, print what would
#                           be resolved without mutating.
#
# Default mode (no flags): equivalent to --list.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — no unresolved threads
#   1 — bad arguments
#   2 — gh failure (auth, missing PR, network)
#   3 — unresolved threads exist (in --list mode); call again with
#       --auto-resolve-bots after addressing findings, or resolve
#       human-authored threads via the GitHub UI.

# Fetch all review threads with isResolved state. Three design
# choices, all load-bearing:
#
# 1. `-F cursor=null` (typed) on the first call, NOT `-f cursor=null`
#    (string). The prior code used `-f cursor=null` which sent the
#    literal STRING "null" as the cursor; GitHub's GraphQL endpoint
#    interpreted that as a real cursor and silently returned the
#    wrong thread set. This was the actual root cause of the
#    PR #189 undercount (May 2026 — initially misdiagnosed as
#    eventual consistency; #192 has the post-mortem). The cursor-
#    state branching below sends GraphQL null on the first call,
#    then a real cursor string on subsequent pages.
#
# 2. Two GraphQL aliases — `commentsFirst: comments(first: 1)` for
#    the original review's author/path/body (what the user/agent
#    needs to recognize the thread) AND `commentsLast: comments(last:
#    1)` for the HEAD-anchor commit_oid (the truly-latest comment).
#    Earlier draft used `comments(first: 50)` and indexed `[-1]` for
#    the last comment, but Codex P2 on PR #194 caught that >50-comment
#    threads (rare but possible — bot churn over a long-lived PR)
#    would misclassify HEAD anchor. The dual-alias shape is
#    deterministic for any thread depth.
#
# 3. `totalCount` cross-validation — after assembling THREADS_JSON,
#    compare the returned node count against the API's reported
#    totalCount. If they disagree the script reports on stderr +
#    exits 2 rather than the silent "no unresolved threads" output
#    that bit PR #189. Belt-and-suspenders: even with the cursor fix
#    above, a future API quirk could re-introduce undercount; the
#    cross-check catches it.
#
# Codex P2 on PR #172 caught that the prior `first: 100` (no pager)
# could undercount on PRs with many threads — paginating with
# `first: 50` + cursor preserves that fix.

# CURSOR sentinel "" means "first call — send GraphQL null". A string
