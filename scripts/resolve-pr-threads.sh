# resolve-pr-threads.sh — Enumerate and resolve open review threads on a PR.
#
# Branch protection on `main` typically requires
# `required_conversation_resolution: true`, which means **every review
# thread on the PR must be resolved** before `mergeStateStatus` flips
# from `BLOCKED` to `CLEAN`. This includes CodeRabbit's `🧹 Nitpick` /
# `🔵 Trivial` comments that don't block merge in CodeRabbit's own
# model but DO block the conversation-resolution gate.
#
# The blocker is invisible in `gh pr checks` output — only the GitHub
# UI surfaces it. This script fills the discoverability gap.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/resolve-pr-threads.sh <PR#> [--repo owner/name] [--list]
#                                 [--auto-resolve-bots] [--dry-run]
#                                 [--rationale <text>] [--no-tag-reply]
#
# Modes:
#   --list                  List unresolved threads with author + path +
#                           first-comment excerpt. No mutations.
#   --auto-resolve-bots     Resolve threads whose author is a bot
#                           (CodeRabbit, Codex Connector, Dependabot)
#                           AND whose latest comment is on the current
#                           HEAD. Use ONLY when:
#                           - The agent has already addressed each
#                             finding in a fix commit on this HEAD, OR
#                             posted a rebuttal reply, AND
#                           - The bot author has not auto-resolved in
#                             a reasonable window.
#                           Per REVIEW_POLICY.md § Implementation notes
#                           for branch protection gates: this is a
#                           CLEAN-UP mechanism, not a policy override.
#                           Human-authored threads are NEVER auto-
#                           resolved regardless of mode.
#   --dry-run               With --auto-resolve-bots, print what would
#                           be resolved without mutating.
#   --rationale <text>      With --auto-resolve-bots, override the
#                           auto-synthesized class with a free-form
#                           rationale. Class defaults to
#                           `deferred-to-followup` (most common manual
#                           case); the free-form text follows the tag.
#                           Useful when the auto-heuristic would
#                           misclassify (e.g. P2 deferred to a tracked
#                           follow-up issue). Implies tag-reply emission.
#   --no-tag-reply          With --auto-resolve-bots, suppress the
#                           pre-resolution `[mergepath-resolve:<class>]`
#                           reply emission. The resolve mutation still
#                           runs. Useful for dry-rehearsal of the
#                           resolve loop without polluting the thread
#                           history. The default IS to emit the tag —
#                           the v1 daily rollup classifier reads it.
#
# Default mode (no flags): equivalent to --list.
#
# Tag emission (mergepath#305):
#   When --auto-resolve-bots runs WITHOUT --no-tag-reply, the helper
#   posts a one-line reply on each bot thread BEFORE the resolve
#   mutation:
#
#     [mergepath-resolve: <class>] <one-line rationale>
#
#   where `<class>` is one of (taxonomy mirrored from the v1 daily
#   rollup classifier in scripts/lib/daily-feedback-rollup-helpers.sh):
#     addressed-elsewhere   fix-commit by an agent author after the
#                           comment's createdAt, touching the anchored
#                           file (or any file when per-file detection
#                           is unavailable)
#     canonical-coverage    path matches a canonical entry in
#                           .mergepath-sync.yml (propagated content)
#     nitpick-noted         severity is Nitpick/Trivial/P3 and no
#                           stronger signal applies
#     rebuttal-recorded     a substantive agent-authored reply (≥30
#                           chars) is on the thread
#     deferred-to-followup  default fallback / --rationale override
#
#   Tag emission failure is logged + skipped (does NOT block the
#   resolve mutation). The rollup's classifier accepts any string
#   matching the regex; unknown classes route to "surface" per spec.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — no unresolved threads
#   1 — bad arguments
#   2 — gh failure (auth, missing PR, network)
#   3 — unresolved threads exist (in --list mode); call again with
#       --auto-resolve-bots after addressing findings, or resolve
#       human-authored threads via the GitHub UI.

# Fetch all review threads with isResolved state. Three design
# choices, all load-bearing:
#
# 1. `-F cursor=null` (typed) on the first call, NOT `-f cursor=null`
#    (string). The prior code used `-f cursor=null` which sent the
#    literal STRING "null" as the cursor; GitHub's GraphQL endpoint
#    interpreted that as a real cursor and silently returned the
#    wrong thread set. This was the actual root cause of the
#    PR #189 undercount (May 2026 — initially misdiagnosed as
#    eventual consistency; #192 has the post-mortem). The cursor-
#    state branching below sends GraphQL null on the first call,
#    then a real cursor string on subsequent pages.
#
# 2. Two GraphQL aliases — `commentsFirst: comments(first: 1)` for
#    the original review's author/path/body (what the user/agent
#    needs to recognize the thread) AND `commentsLast: comments(last:
#    1)` for the HEAD-anchor commit_oid (the truly-latest comment).
#    Earlier draft used `comments(first: 50)` and indexed `[-1]` for
#    the last comment, but Codex P2 on PR #194 caught that >50-comment
#    threads (rare but possible — bot churn over a long-lived PR)
#    would misclassify HEAD anchor. The dual-alias shape is
#    deterministic for any thread depth.
#
# 3. `totalCount` cross-validation — after assembling THREADS_JSON,
#    compare the returned node count against the API's reported
#    totalCount. If they disagree the script reports on stderr +
#    exits 2 rather than the silent "no unresolved threads" output
#    that bit PR #189. Belt-and-suspenders: even with the cursor fix
#    above, a future API quirk could re-introduce undercount; the
#    cross-check catches it.
#
# Codex P2 on PR #172 caught that the prior `first: 100` (no pager)
# could undercount on PRs with many threads — paginating with
# `first: 50` + cursor preserves that fix.

#
# Before each resolveReviewThread mutation, post a one-line reply on
# the thread with `[mergepath-resolve: <class>] <rationale>`. The
# v1 daily rollup classifier in
# scripts/lib/daily-feedback-rollup-helpers.sh reads this tag and
# prioritizes it over its own heuristics. The taxonomy (the five
# valid `<class>` values) MUST match what the classifier accepts —
# unknown class strings route to "surface" per the rollup spec,
# which is acceptable but defeats the purpose.
#
# We intentionally do NOT source the rollup helpers file: it is not
# in .mergepath-sync.yml, and sourcing it would either break
# propagation OR force the helpers to travel with the canonical
# resolve script. Instead we inline the small bits we need here
# (regex shape, agent-author check, severity sniff). The
# canonical taxonomy lives in the helpers file's case-statement
# comments — this script must stay in step.
