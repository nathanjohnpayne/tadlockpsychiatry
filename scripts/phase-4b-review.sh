# scripts/phase-4b-review.sh — Phase 4b AUTOMATED review orchestrator.
#
# REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION (#<this-feature>). Replaces the human shuttle in
# REVIEW_POLICY.md § Phase 4b with an orchestrated, headless CLI review:
# select the external reviewer (≠ author), dispatch to the direction-
# specific adapter (codex exec / claude -p), then post the resulting
# verdict under the reviewer PAT via scripts/gh-as-reviewer.sh. An
# APPROVED review on the current HEAD from a non-author reviewer identity
# is exactly the "Phase 4b substitute" clearance the existing merge gate
# (scripts/codex-review-check.sh, codex.allow_phase_4b_substitute, #218)
# already accepts — so this script changes NO merge-gate code.
#
# Design: plans/automated-phase-4b-handoff.md.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/phase-4b-review.sh <PR#> [--repo owner/repo]
#       [--reviewer nathanpayne-<agent>] [--author <agent>]
#       [--head <sha>] [--expected-base-sha <sha>] [--diff-file <path>]
#       [--dry-run] [--force-enabled]
#
# Overrides (mostly for tests / non-git contexts):
#   --author         PR's authoring agent (claude|codex|...). NOT an override
#                    (#1143): the PR body is read and validated against the
#                    shared contract on every run, and this flag is only
#                    cross-checked against the `Authoring-Agent:` the body
#                    declares. A disagreement fails closed (exit 3); omitting
#                    the flag simply skips the cross-check. There is no way to
#                    make Phase 4b act on an identity the body does not carry.
#   --reviewer       force the external reviewer login (skips selection, but
#                    still must differ from the authoring agent).
#   --head           HEAD sha. Default: gh api pulls/<n> .head.sha.
#   --expected-base-sha
#                    Optional 40-hex base SHA fence for a caller that already
#                    captured the PR's base with its head. When supplied, the
#                    live head/base pair is read together before adapter work,
#                    before post-review issue filing, and immediately before
#                    the review POST. A moved or unreadable base fails closed.
#   --diff-file      pre-fetched unified diff (skips `gh pr diff`).
#   --dry-run        do everything EXCEPT post the review; print intended
#                    action.
#   --force-enabled  run this one invocation even when
#                    phase_4b_automation.enabled is false/absent in
#                    .github/review-policy.yml (#1046). Overrides ONLY
#                    `enabled` — mode, fail_closed and post_review_issues
#                    still come from config, and the reviewer-≠-author gate
#                    is never overridable. The emitted JSON's `enabled_via`
#                    reads "override" instead of "config" so a review posted
#                    this way is auditable after the fact. Same env
#                    equivalent as every other flag here: P4B_FORCE_ENABLED=1.
#                    The trusted-path rule (#628) still applies UNCHANGED —
#                    this must still run from a trusted main-ref checkout,
#                    never the PR-under-review's own checkout — and matters
#                    more here, since a per-run flag invites running it ad
#                    hoc from whatever directory happens to be open.
#
# Env:
#   GH_TOKEN / op-preflight cache   reviewer-scoped token (auto-sourced).
#   CODEX_BIN / CLAUDE_BIN          adapter CLI overrides (tests).
#   P4B_GH_AS_REVIEWER              reviewer wrapper override (tests).
#   P4B_GH_AS_AUTHOR                author wrapper override (tests) — used
#                                   for the step-9 post-review issue writes.
#   P4B_HANDOFF                     manual handoff renderer override (tests).
#   P4B_FORCE_ENABLED               1/true — same as --force-enabled.
#   P4B_ADAPTER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS     env override for the outer adapter-call
#                                   timeout; default is resolved per-adapter
#                                   from phase_4b_automation (900 when absent).
#   Timeout + effort are otherwise read from phase_4b_automation
#   (adapter_timeout_seconds / <adapter>_timeout_seconds / <adapter>_effort;
#   see p4b_resolve_adapter_timeout / p4b_resolve_adapter_effort) and passed to
#   the adapter via P4B_REVIEW_CLI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS / P4B_{CLAUDE,CODEX}_EFFORT.
#   A malformed or out-of-range config fails closed (exit 3).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  APPROVED — review posted (or would post under --dry-run).
#   1  CHANGES_REQUESTED — review posted; the author must address findings.
#   3  usage / infrastructure error.
#   4  fell back to the manual handoff (adapter error/timeout, invalid
#      verdict, or no adapter for the selected reviewer). The chat-side
#      block from scripts/post-phase-4b-handoff.sh is emitted on stderr.
#   5  automation disabled or mode != local — caller uses the manual
#      handoff (today's behavior). Not an error.
#   6  held: external review has not reached the reviewed head yet (#814).
#      NOT a fallback and NOT an unavailable reviewer — no handoff block is
#      emitted. An early hold records no loop; a final pre-POST timeout-
#      generation retraction corrects its already-provisional loop to
#      not-posted/fail-closed. The JSON carries barrier_pending:true and
#      retry_after; the caller should retry after that many seconds.
#      Deliberately distinct from 4 so that every existing
#      consumer of 4 keeps its meaning: AGENTS.md, REVIEW_POLICY.md and
#      scripts/wave-audit.sh all treat 4 as a reviewer that will not answer,
#      and wave-audit proceeds fail-open on it — which would be wrong for a
#      wait that clears on its own.
#   7  FEEDBACK_UNACCOUNTED — a reviewer finding has no durable disposition.
#      Before dispatch, account for findings and rerun (#1000). After a posted
#      approval, review_posted:true identifies an acknowledgment to repair
#      without repeating the review. No handoff block is emitted.
#   8  HUMAN_TIEBREAKER_REQUIRED — the governing Codex request cap is
#      exhausted with no automated response path left. No adapter is run and
#      no Phase 4b handoff is rendered; a human must decide the PR's state.
#   10 BARRIER_EVIDENCE_ERROR — request-budget evidence was unreadable or the
#      head moved. No adapter is run and no Phase 4b handoff is rendered.

# WHY A GLOBAL AND NOT A RETURN STATUS — do not "tidy" this into one (#1143).
# p4b_acct_mark_unposted is ADVISORY by contract: it must never change the

#
#     X || { p4b_acct_mark_unposted "..."; p4b_die N "..."; }
#
# and bash applies errexit to commands inside the group following the FINAL
# `||`. A non-zero return from the first command in that group therefore
# aborts the run *before* the intended `p4b_die N`, silently turning an
# advisory accounting failure into a different exit code — precisely the
# contract violation the function promises cannot happen. A seventh call site
# is bare inside an `if` body, with the same consequence. Making the status the
# channel would leave the contract depending on every present and future caller
# remembering `|| true`, which is a convention, not a guarantee.
#
# The global keeps the advisory guarantee structural (the function cannot
# abort a caller) while still making the outcome observable to the one caller
# that needs it.
#
# STALENESS: p4b_acct_mark_unposted resets this to true on entry, before any
# early return, so a reader always sees the outcome of the attempt it just
# triggered and never a leftover from an earlier one. Readers additionally
# default it to FALSE when unset, not true — see the read site — so the
# unreachable case fails toward "we did not correct it" (a retry, harmless and
# idempotent) rather than toward "we did" (a durable phantom posted record,
# which is the defect this whole variable exists to prevent).

# The identity fence at the top of this script reads the PR body exactly ONCE,
# and the adapter run that follows can last the configured timeout (900s by
# default). Every drift check between that read and the review POST compares
# HEAD shas — and editing a PR body does not move HEAD, so a mid-run identity
# change passes all of them untouched.
#
# The concrete attack that closes: a run starts against a body declaring
# `codex`, so it selects the CLAUDE reviewer; while the adapter reasons, the
# body is edited to declare `claude`; the run then files follow-up issues and
# posts an APPROVED as nathanpayne-claude on a PR whose declared authoring
# agent is now claude. That is the cross-agent invariant broken by the same
# mechanism the up-front fence exists to close, one layer deeper in time.
#
# Returns 0 only when the LIVE body still satisfies the contract AND still
# declares the agent this run was planned against ($AUTHOR_AGENT, normalized).
# Every unmodelled input is drift, not a pass: an unreadable read, an empty
# body, and a body that no longer validates all return 1. Callers own the
# cleanup, so this reuses the head-drift call sites rather than adding a
# second drift idiom — the reason lands in P4B_BODY_DRIFT_REASON so no caller
# has to infer status through a command substitution.

# laundered into a clean approval by rerunning the reviewer on the SAME head
# with no fix commit. Here we run the SAME assertion against the live loop log
# keyed to the current HEAD, in same_head_only mode (#615 round 9 CodeRabbit:
# the current loop is legitimately ABSENT from the log whenever recording
# failed or accounting is disabled, so the record-scoped clauses must not
# apply); when it refuses, the approval is REFUSED via the manual handoff
# (fall_back_to_manual, exit 4), never posted. A head change (a real fix
# commit) or a fail-closed-marked prior loop clears it — the assertion permits
# the legitimate changes-requested-then-fixed path.
#
# Placement (#615 Codex round 10): this gate sits OUTSIDE the p4b_acct_on
# sub-toggle block above, guarded on P4B_ACCT_AVAILABLE (module loaded) alone.
# Inside that block, opting out via phase_4b_automation.accounting.enabled:
# false AFTER a prior loop logged a required finding on this head would skip
# the gate and launder the finding through a same-head rerun. Out here the
# toggle only stops NEW recording; history already on disk still blocks. Gate
# is a no-op when the verdict is not APPROVED, when there is no
# readable/parseable loop log, or when the module never loaded
# (P4B_ACCT_AVAILABLE=false: nothing ever recorded history, so there is no
# history to launder — and the hook function does not exist, so a bare call
# would exit 127 into fall_back_to_manual and refuse every valid approval the
# module-missing contract at the top of this file says must post plain; #615
# round 9, CodeRabbit).
