# scripts/lib/daily-feedback-rollup-helpers.sh
#
# Pure helper functions for daily-feedback-rollup.sh, split out so the
# unit tests in tests/test_daily_feedback_rollup.sh can source them
# directly without running the script's main body (which assumes
# GH_TOKEN + a live gh shim). Each function takes simple string args
# and produces stdout — no GitHub I/O, no temp files.
#
# To use:
#   source scripts/lib/daily-feedback-rollup-helpers.sh
#
# AGENT_AUTHORS is the only piece of state the helpers need at module
# load. Set it before sourcing or accept the canonical default.

# parse_triaged_ids_from_body <rollup-body> → newline-separated mp-ids
#
# Scans a prior rollup issue body line-by-line and emits, on stdout,
# the `mp-id` of every line item considered "already triaged" — i.e.
# excluded from future rollups (issue #304 dedupe pass).
#
# Triage signals recognised on a single rollup line:
#   - Checkbox `[x]` or `[X]`              → fix landed / won't-fix / followup-filed
#   - Checkbox `[~]` or `[-]`              → N/A / not-relevant
#   - Strikethrough wrapping the bullet    → `~~- [ ] ... ~~`
#   - A `#N` issue reference on the line   → follow-up filed
#
# Caller is responsible for the **closed host issue** signal: if the
# rollup issue itself is closed, the caller should treat every mp-id
# from its body as triaged (regardless of per-line state). We don't
# do it here because this helper has no view of issue state — it gets
# only the body text. The caller can use this helper's output for the
# "closed-host implies all triaged" branch by re-running it with a
# fall-through: parse_all_ids_from_body for closed hosts (skip the
# per-line signal check). For simplicity, this helper exposes a
# second mode via `parse_all_ids_from_body`.
#
# Per-item follow-up-link granularity trade-off: a reply ON a specific
# checklist line is not addressable in plain Markdown — replies live
# in the issue-comment stream, not on a specific bullet. The spec
# permits the simpler interpretation: "any `#N` reference on the
# line itself counts as a follow-up signal for THAT line." Reply-
# comments on the host issue that mention `#N` without anchoring to
# a specific mp-id are intentionally NOT consumed here; the
# follow-up-filed user signal is to drop the `#N` into the bullet
# text itself, which the agent or human triaging the rollup can do
# in one edit. This keeps the helper a pure body-string parser with
# no API I/O.
#
# Bash 3.2 + POSIX awk compatible. Output is mp-id per line, no
# duplicates (dedupe within the helper so the caller's set-membership
# check is O(1) per candidate).
parse_triaged_ids_from_body() {
  # awk processes the body line-by-line, extracts the mp-id from
  # `<!-- mp-id:XXXXXXXXXXXX -->`, and prints it only if the same line
  # carries a triage signal. We use awk (not bash + grep loop) so a
  # 200-line rollup body parses in a single subprocess. POSIX-portable
