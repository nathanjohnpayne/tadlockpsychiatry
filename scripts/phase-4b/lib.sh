# --- same-head provider barrier: terminality (#814) -------------------------
#
# Each enabled provider arm resolves to exactly one class per probe:
#
#   reported          a terminal signal exists on THIS head
#   will-not-report   the provider will never post on this head
#   waived            it will not report in any useful window, and policy
#                     explicitly permits proceeding without it
#   not-yet           it has not posted on this head YET
#   rate-limited      it has REFUSED to report and no wait this run can make
#                     lasts long enough to lift the refusal (#1178)
#   escalate          a stuck condition only a human can clear
#   carried           (CodeRabbit only, #1335) it will not report on this
#                     head, but its completed review of an earlier head with
#                     the identical external-review fingerprint carries
#                     forward — see p4b_barrier_coderabbit_carryforward
#
# `reported`, `will-not-report`, `waived` and `carried` let the barrier open.
# `carried` is not assigned by the pure classifier below: it refines a
# classifier `not-yet` inside the barrier, which alone does the I/O. `not-yet`
# is a bounded, self-clearing wait; `escalate` goes to the human immediately.
# `rate-limited` is the one class the CLASSIFIER cannot resolve on its own —
# it names the provider's state and the composer decides, because the answer
# depends on whether the OTHER provider reported. See p4b_same_head_barrier.
#
# `waived` is deliberately a separate class rather than reuse of `reported`,
# which would claim a report that never happened, or of `will-not-report`,
# which would claim permanence a rate limit does not have. It names the actual
# situation: a policy decision to proceed without this provider on this head.
#
# The split exists because treating "any terminal-looking rc" as satisfied
# makes the barrier a universal pass: rc 4 means "has not reported", and rc 6
# with skip_reason=paused means "is refusing to report until resumed" — the
# #593 false-clear precedent. Both must read as not-yet.

      # .commit_id == head from the bot's own login) whenever one exists
      # while the summary publication is masked. On #866 the fair-use limit
      # note appended to the finished-review reply read the whole
      # publication as rate_limited while coderabbitai[bot] had two
      # COMMENTED review objects on the exact head (and a per-SHA
      # StatusContext success) — and the barrier held not-yet until its
      # budget escalated.
      #
      # The object alone is NOT enough (P1 on #875): CodeRabbit publishes
      # the review object and the PR-level summary as separate events, the
      # summary can carry the ONLY blocking marker (the #535 summary-only
      # class — e.g. the auto-pause note), and the probe deliberately
      # returns rc 7 observed=awaiting-summary for exactly that
      # mid-publication state. What discriminates the wedged-but-complete
      # #866 state from a just-posted object is the per-SHA CodeRabbit
      # StatusContext reading success on this head, which the probe samples
      # into probe.context_state on this one path (null when unsampled, or
      # when trust_status_context_for_clearance is false — both fail closed
      # here to not-yet).
      #
      # And the success must be TEMPORALLY CORRELATED with the object it
      # corroborates (#875 round 2): on a repeated CodeRabbit run against
      # the SAME sha the statuses endpoint still exposes the PREVIOUS
      # run's success while the new object's summary and status refresh
      # are pending — co-present, but from different runs. So the third
      # conjunct requires probe.context_updated_at (the status' refresh
      # time, sampled alongside the state) at-or-after review.submitted_at
      # (the evidence object's own timestamp, emitted for exactly this
      # comparison). Either field missing, or either timestamp
      # unparseable, fails closed to not-yet — old probe JSON simply keeps
      # the barrier on its pre-#869 bounded wait.
      #
      # Which object review.submitted_at names is settled upstream, and it
      # has to be a review RUN (#900): CodeRabbit also creates a review
      # object for a CONVERSATIONAL REPLY on a thread — its answer to a
      # rebuttal or to a resolve tag reply — and a reply starts no run, so
      # no further StatusContext is ever published for that head. Anchoring
      # on one made this comparison unsatisfiable rather than merely
      # pending, and the barrier burned its whole budget on a provider that
      # had finished. crw_select_head_pinned_review_run in
      # scripts/coderabbit-wait.sh excludes replies by their empty body, so
      # what arrives here is the newest run; with no run on the head the
      # probe emits no `review` at all and the first conjunct fails closed.
      #
      # And an ACTIVE adverse state named by the probe takes precedence
      # over the evidence pair (P1 round 3 on #875): probe.observed on
      # this branch is the class of the newest pending notice beneath the
      # review object, and rate_limit / paused / in_progress each assert
      # that CodeRabbit is NOT done here — a durable pause or a fresh
      # limit notice can be exactly what is holding the summary that
      # carries the only blocking marker, and a postdating spurious
      # success (#595) must not outrank the notice that names the real
      # state. Only the completion family opens: awaiting-summary (the
      # value this branch emits when nothing adverse is pending) or
      # terminal. A missing or unmodelled observed fails closed to
      # not-yet.
      #
      # With all conjuncts the claim matches what the Codex arm accepts
      # (#684): CodeRabbit has reviewed AND completed the head about to be
      # approved. Inline findings stay owned by
      # coderabbit-severity-gate.sh, so counting the set as reported skips
      # no disposition; the disclosed residual is a spurious success
      # (#595) landing on this exact head AND postdating the head's own
      # review object while its summary is still in flight WITH no adverse
      # notice pending, which would skip the #535 summary-only escalation.
      # endpoint must be "reviews": the probe's "issues" evidence on rc 7
      # is a pending notice or a prior-head summary, never head-anchored
      # terminality. The head equality is belt-and-braces on top of the

      #   - p4b_barrier_should_trigger declines on rate_limit by design, so

      #   - the one path that DOES re-ask is the polling mode's backoff
      #     retry, which --probe cannot reach — it "posts NOTHING".

      # naming a timeout rather than the refusal (#826 measured the budget
      # at roughly half the observed window, so it stalls on arrival). And
      # the observation need not age out — on the review-object branch the
      # limit stanza is written into the summarize comment IN PLACE, whose
      # fresh_at stays at-or-after the review object, so the anchored
      # expiry the triage relies on never arrives.

# --- same-head provider barrier: same-content CodeRabbit carry-forward (#1335)
#
# p4b_barrier_coderabbit_carryforward <repo> <pr> <head> <probe-rc> <probe-json>
#
# Emits one JSON object and returns 0 when CodeRabbit's review of an earlier
# head carries forward to <head>, 1 when it does not. Never escalates: every
# failure, missing input and mismatch is "not carried", which leaves the arm on
# the ordinary bounded not-yet it already had. The helper can only ever turn a
# not-yet into `carried`; nothing else reaches it.
#
# WHY this exists. CodeRabbit does not review merge commits. On a base-only
# update head — a merge from the base branch that touches none of the PR's own
# files — its auto-review completes with no review object and leaves the
# summary range naming the last CONTENT head, and the barrier's own
# `@coderabbitai review` is answered "Already reviewed the last commit". So
# the arm can never leave not-yet there, and every such head waited out the
# whole budget and fell back to the manual handoff (#1318, heads a76fa31 and
# d1682c9).
#
# WHAT carries. Not "CodeRabbit said it already reviewed" — that reply names
# no commit, and a merge commit can carry conflict resolutions in the PR's own
# files. What carries is CodeRabbit's completed review of commit L, where the
# #705 external-review fingerprint of L equals the fingerprint of <head>. That
# fingerprint hashes the tree entries of every path the PR changes, at the
# ref AND at its merge base, so equality means the PR content — the diff the
# approval is about to certify — is byte-identical. It is the same test
# scripts/codex-review-check.sh uses to carry a Codex verdict across a
# base-only update (scripts/workflow/external_review_carryforward.sh), and its
# note there on why a fingerprint match is SUFFICIENT applies unchanged.
#
# The conjuncts, each closing a specific way to carry past something unread:
#   probe rc 7                  a not-yet; rc 2 (a summary-only finding) and
#                               every other rc keep their own routing
#   observed none |             nothing adverse is pending — a pause, a limit
#     summary-without-head-     or a run in progress on this head is not a
#     review                    finished CodeRabbit
#   carryforward.reviewed_head  the probe found a completed, benign,
#                               marker-free summary with ONE range end
#                               (crw_probe_carryforward_evidence)
#   head status success and     CodeRabbit has processed THIS head and
#     permits clearance         finished with it — so it will not publish a
#                               late finding on it — and the success is not
#                               the `Review rate limited` kind (#891)
#   fingerprints equal and      identical PR content; an empty fingerprint
#     non-empty                 (no external review required, or >=3000
#                               files) proves nothing and does not carry
#
# Both fingerprints are computed from ONE changed-file list, so they hash the
# same path set, and that list is <head>'s own (compare/<base>...<head>), so no
# push, force-push or intervening head can substitute another head's set.
# The CodeRabbit configuration file must also be identical at both commits.
#
# Deliberately CodeRabbit-only. The Codex arm keeps its head-identity contract
# (--diagnostic-signal-only disables the #705 Codex carry-forward), because
# Codex DOES re-review a merge head when asked. The barrier relaxes head
# identity only for the provider that structurally cannot satisfy it.

# --- same-head provider barrier: bounded not-yet retry (#814) ---------------
#
# phase-4b-review.sh is one-shot, so "retry until a bound" cannot be an
# in-process sleep without holding the process open for up to the full
# coderabbit.max_wait_seconds at each of two evaluation points. The bound
# instead rides a marker keyed to (repo, PR, head), written on the first
# not-yet for that head and removed on every other outcome.
#
# Whose clock: the LOCAL clock of the trusted checkout running the
# orchestrator — the same one the accounting hooks already use. Deliberately
# NOT a GitHub timestamp, and deliberately not the head committer date, which
# the pusher controls.
#
# The marker asserts no provider event. It records only "this checkout began
# waiting at T"; terminality comes solely from the probe rc and its head_sha,
# so no value of the clock can turn a not-yet provider into a reported one.
# Both tamper directions fail safe: an artificially OLD marker exhausts the
# budget early and hands the PR to a human, posting no review; a missing, new,
# or future-dated marker restarts the budget and the barrier keeps returning
# pending — also posting no review. The clock decides only WHEN to stop
# retrying and involve a human, which is conservative either way.

# Wall-clock bound for the pending wait, from coderabbit.max_wait_seconds.
# A malformed value falls back to the default rather than failing closed: this

# which exhausts any budget on the first read and hands every retry to a human.
# `0899` is not a legal octal literal at all: the arithmetic expansion fails
# outright ("value too great for base") and note_pending returns non-zero with
# no elapsed. And a digit run wider than int64 makes `[ -gt ]` error with
# "integer expression expected" while `$(( ))` wraps to a NEGATIVE elapsed,

# p4b_barrier_claim_root
# Where claims live. Deliberately NOT the checkout's state dir (#858): the
# pending marker measures how long THIS checkout has waited and is rightly
# per-checkout, but a claim is a reservation over a shared external resource —
# the PR timeline — so scoping it to the checkout serialized nothing between
# two Phase 4b invocations run from two trusted checkouts, and both posted.
#
# Per-user, per-HOST, checkout-independent. The host component is load-bearing
# rather than cosmetic: ownership is a PID (below), and PIDs are comparable
# only within one machine. On a networked or synced home directory a bare
# shared root would let machine B read machine A's live PID, find some
# unrelated local process alive at that number, and decline forever — or find
# it dead and steal a live claim. Keying the root by host keeps the PID test
# meaning what it says, at the cost of not coordinating across machines, where
# no filesystem lock could have coordinated anyway.
#
# Falls back to the old per-checkout location only when there is no home to
# anchor on, which preserves today's behaviour rather than failing closed in a
# configuration that has always worked.
#
# Residue: a process killed inside the region strands one directory holding one
# pid file. It is reaped by the next claimant on the same key, so an active key
# self-heals; a key never revisited (an old PR head) just leaves the empty pair
# behind. The whole root is safe to delete when no Phase 4b run is in flight —
# the durable record of what was posted is the timeline marker, never a claim.
#
# EVERY branch is ABSOLUTE BY CONSTRUCTION: each `printf` is either guarded by
# a `/*` case or derived from `p4b_repo_root`, which resolves through `cd -P`.
#
# A RELATIVE operator-supplied root is IGNORED rather than used, and the next
# branch decides. This is the one treatment that keeps the guarantee #858 is
# about. Anchoring a relative root at `$PWD` — the intermediate shape this
# function briefly carried — makes it absolute without making it
# checkout-independent: two invocations started from two directories still
# expand the same relative override to two different roots, which is the split
# reintroduced through an operator-supplied directory instead of through the
# default (CodeRabbit round 1 asked for reject-or-absolutise; Codex P2 round 2
# showed that absolutise-at-cwd is not enough, and both are satisfied by
# ignoring). It also matches what the XDG base-directory spec already requires
# of a reader for a relative `XDG_STATE_HOME`, so all three variables now obey
# one rule instead of three.
#
# Falling through is safe in every direction: an ignored `P4B_CLAIM_DIR` lands
# on the shared per-user root, which is *more* serialized than what the
# operator asked for, never less.

#
# Deliberately no timestamp and no clock-based stale-breaking: every such
# rule either steals a live claim (two writes — the failure this exists to
# prevent) or strands a second one. Ownership is the winner's PID instead:
# claims are per-HOST by construction (see p4b_barrier_claim_root), so a
# recorded owner that is no longer alive on this machine proves abandonment,
# and only the NEXT claimant breaks it — never any concurrent evaluation. A
# clear_pending that removed claims was the round-1 defect here: an open or
# drift outcome in one invocation deleted another invocation's LIVE claim
# mid-region, and a third retry could then re-claim and double-post.
#
# The owner recorded is BASHPID, not `$$` (#859). `$$` is the PID of the
# shell that STARTED bash and does not change inside a subshell, and every
# caller reaches this through `out="$(p4b_barrier_maybe_write …)"` — a command
# substitution, hence a subshell. Recording `$$` therefore named a process
# that is not the one executing the claimed region, and got the liveness test
# backwards in both directions: when the subshell died the parent stayed
# alive, so the claim read as held and NO later claimant could ever reap it;
# and when the parent died first the claim read as abandoned, so another
# caller could reap it while the original subshell was still mid-post — then
# the original's release deleted the successor's live claim. BASHPID names the

# --- #814 CodeRabbit arm: trigger, do not only wait -------------------------
#
# The barrier point is also the right trigger point: it fires only once Codex
# is terminal on the head, which is exactly the settled head worth spending
# CodeRabbit's allowance on. A pure waiter is sound ONLY while
# reviews.auto_review.auto_incremental_review is true. Turn that off (#826
# step 2) and nothing asks CodeRabbit to look at a Phase 4b head: the probe
# returns observed=none forever, the bound exhausts, and every Phase 4b
# escalates to a human — a cost problem converted into a throughput problem.
# Design change recorded on #814.

# The idempotency anchor is a SHA-bearing marker, deliberately NOT "a trigger
# comment newer than the head". That would reintroduce the defect fixed on
# #823 in 0955ac8: the head committer date is set by whoever pushed, so a
# future-dated head makes every prior trigger look stale and the arm re-posts
# on every bounded retry — multiplying straight into the allowance this exists
# to conserve. The probe cannot close it either: between posting and
# CodeRabbit reacting, observed is still `none`, which is the same sub-minute
# race that produced two @codex review triggers on #820.

#
# THE MARKER ARM HAS TWO HALVES when a <family_key> is given (the resume kind
# — see p4b_barrier_maybe_resume for how the two keys are formed):
#
#   exact <key>   — counted regardless of age. <key> pins the pause note AND
#                   the head, and re-pausing costs the bot new reviewed
#                   commits, which costs a new head, so within one head our
#                   own marked resume is unconditionally the answer to this
#                   note. This half is what makes the dedup idempotent across
#                   an IN-PLACE EDIT of the note: CodeRabbit edits one pause
#                   comment (a Finishing-Touches checkbox tick bumps it) and
#                   every freshness-derived identity — a fresh_at in the key,
#                   or a fresh_at conjunct on its own — mints a new episode on
#                   each edit and posts again. The head does not move when the
#                   note is edited, so this half cannot be bumped that way.
#   <family_key>  — any marked resume for the SAME pause note under a
#                   different head, counted only when it was created at or
#                   after <since> (the note's CodeRabbit-owned fresh_at). This
#                   is #862's second remedy and it carries the cross-head
#                   dedup round 1 asked for: a standing pause note that has
#                   not changed since we answered it is still answered, so a
#                   Codex-forced push does not buy a second resume, while a
#                   note REWRITTEN after our resume (the new pause episode
#                   #862 is about) is not, and the recovery fires again. `>=`,
#                   not `>`: second-precision timestamps let our own resume
#                   tie the note it answers, and a tie is an answer.
#                   With <since> empty — a note whose freshness we could not
#                   read — the family counts unconditionally, i.e. the
#                   historical at-most-once per note id, which spends nothing.
#
# <family_key> MUST end with the key separator (`pause-771-`, never
# `pause-771`): the family is matched as a marker PREFIX, and the separator is
# what stops note 771's family from also matching note 7710's keys. The family
# match additionally accepts the pre-#862 id-only marker spelling — the family
# key minus that trailing separator — so a PR already carrying one from an
# earlier run is not resumed a second time on the first run after this ships.
#
# Residual, deliberately: a new head PLUS an in-place edit of a standing note
# satisfies neither half and buys one extra resume — bounded at one per head,
# where the pre-fix shape was one per edit.
#
# For the resume kind, a BARE `@<bot> resume` first line also counts when it
# was created after <since>: coderabbit-wait.sh's own pause recovery posts
# exactly that body with no marker, and two dedup vocabularies that cannot
# read each other's writes double-post against one pause note (Codex P2,
# round 2). Neither timestamp is pusher-controlled. STRICTLY later here, not
# >=: GitHub timestamps carry second precision, so a prior episode's resume
# can tie the new note's fresh_at — counting it would leave the new pause
# unrecovered until escalation, while not counting it risks at worst one
# duplicate resume inside a one-second window (Codex P2, round 5). The bare
# form deliberately gets NO head-scoped half: it carries no pause-note id, so
# a head-scoped bare resume would suppress every later pause note on that
# same head.
#
# Author scope: the marker arm stays pinned to the SELECTED reviewer — the
# marker proves this automation spent the key. The bare arm accepts every
# identity in available_reviewers (plus the selected one), matching
# coderabbit-wait.sh's own allowlist: its resume may have been posted under
# a different trusted identity (the authoring session's PAT vs this Phase 4b
# session's), and a single-identity filter posts a second resume over it
# (Codex P2, round 3).

# the action taken; never fails the caller, because a write that could not be

#
# <claim_key> defaults to <key> and exists because the MARKER key and the
# MUTUAL-EXCLUSION key answer different questions (Codex P1, round 1). The
# marker records which episode was answered; the claim reserves the right to
# post at all. Scoping the claim by anything finer than the resource being
# reserved silently unserializes concurrent writers: an old-head run that
# already probed a pause and a new-head run started after a push hold two
# different claims, both read the timeline before either comment is visible,
# and both post — the marker scan only dedups writes that have LANDED. The
# resume class therefore claims at pause-note level while marking per head; the
# trigger class reserves one request per head, which is what its key already
# names, so it passes nothing and the default keeps today's behaviour.
#
# The claim wraps the WHOLE read-and-post region (#846): the read and the post
# were not atomic, so two overlapping invocations for the same head could both
# read no-marker and both post — double-spending the five-per-hour allowance
# the marker conserves. mkdir gives one winner with no window; the loser (and
# any invocation that cannot take a claim at all, including on an unusable
# state dir) declines without posting. The claim records nothing and is read
# by nothing — the timeline marker stays the only durable account of what was
# posted, so over-spend is never traded for starvation: a failed post releases
# the claim and the next bounded retry re-attempts.
#
# A DRY RUN takes no claim. The claim reserves the right to POST, and a dry run
# never posts; now that the root is shared across checkouts (#858) rather than
# private to one, a rehearsal that claimed would make a concurrent REAL run
# decline. phase-4b-review.sh already goes to explicit lengths to keep dry-run

          # failover engaged, escalate otherwise — and the reason it was

          # says Codex actually spoke on the exact head about to be
          # approved. That, and not CodeRabbit's participation, is what the
          # barrier's ordering guarantee requires — see the rc-5 note on
          # why waived is the right class for a stall the other provider
          # has already covered.
          #
          # A Codex arm still `not-yet` is the one case that keeps waiting,
          # and the wait is honest because it is a wait on CODEX: that arm
          # is self-clearing, and the next probe can find it reported and
          # open the barrier on it. Escalating here instead would page a
          # human on a PR whose Codex round was about to land — the #835
          # objection to escalating a rate limit unconditionally, which
          # holds just as well when the failover's role is played by the
          # barrier's own Codex arm. What the head-anchored budget already
          # bounds, it keeps bounding; only the reason it escalates with
          # changes, below.
          #
          # WHAT MAKES THE OPEN ARM SAFE, and where that safety lives:
          # `observed: rate_limit` has to mean "refused, with nothing unread
          # behind the refusal". It does not say that for free. CodeRabbit
          # writes its rate-limit stanza INTO the summarize comment it edits
          # in place — the same comment that carries the #535 summary-only
          # finding — and classify_comment is marker-first, so one body can
          # say both and the refusal wins the classification. Opening on that
          # would post an approval over a finding no required gate reads
          # (Codex P1 on #1179). crw_rate_limit_masks_blocking_marker in
          # scripts/coderabbit-wait.sh closes it upstream: such a body emits
          # rc 2, which this classifier already escalates, so a rate_limit
          # that reaches HERE is a bare refusal. That invariant is the
          # precondition for this arm — a probe without the guard must not be
          # paired with it.
          #
          # Every OTHER cls_cx escalates now, `waived` and `disabled`
          # included: in those states nothing will read this head at all, so
          # opening would post an approval with no external corroboration
          # and waiting would spend a budget with nothing to wait on. That

# Implementation (#587): a string-aware brace-depth scanner, not a naive
# first-"{"-to-last-"}" slice. It tracks JSON string literals (honoring \" and
# \\ escapes) so braces inside string VALUES do not change nesting depth, and
# it isolates the first balanced top-level object — so balanced-brace prose
# after the JSON object can no longer extend the slice and poison extraction.
#
# It then requires that to be the ONLY top-level object: if a second `{` opens
# outside a string in the remainder, the output is ambiguous (e.g. a draft
# APPROVED followed by a corrected CHANGES_REQUESTED) and this emits nothing so
# downstream schema validation fails closed rather than silently posting the
# first verdict (#594 Codex). Markdown code fences alone on a line are stripped
# first. Unbalanced, object-free, or multi-object input all emit nothing.

# diff, 6.2 MB of it two committed data files). The adapters therefore bound
# what they pipe to the reviewer CLI: when the diff exceeds the budget, the
# LARGEST per-file sections (bulk artifacts by construction) are omitted
# until it fits, each replaced with an explicit placeholder line, and every
# omission is reported so the adapter can disclose it in the review prompt.
# The reviewer must never be led to believe an omitted file is absent from
# the PR — an undisclosed manual trim on #629 produced exactly that

# p4b_trim_review_diff <in_file> <out_file> <max_bytes> [<omit_globs>]
# Byte-bound a unified diff for reviewer-CLI consumption. Under-budget input
# is copied through verbatim (empty stdout). Over-budget input has its
# largest OMISSION-ELIGIBLE per-file sections omitted, each replaced in the
# output with a single
#   [phase-4b diff-budget: <path> omitted - oversized diff section]
# placeholder line, and one "<path><TAB><bytes>" line per omission printed
# on stdout for the caller's disclosure note. Returns non-zero (fail-closed)
# when omitting every eligible section still cannot meet the budget (never
# omits a non-eligible section), or when no reviewable file section survives
# — the caller must fall back rather than review a husk or approve around
# unreviewed code.
#
# Eligible = EVERY repo path the section touches matches <omit_globs>
# (newline-separated shell globs; see p4b_diff_omit_globs). A section touches
# its b/-side path, its a/-side path, AND — for a rename or copy — the
# `rename from` / `copy from` source and `rename to` / `copy to`
# destination. Checking only the b/-side (the #636 round-1 shape) let a
# large rename FROM a non-allowlisted application path (`src/foo.sh`) TO an
# allowlisted artifact path (`docs/audits/data/foo.sh`) be omitted, hiding
# the removal of application code while an APPROVED could still post (#636
# round-2 P1). Requiring the a/-side and rename/copy source to be
# allowlisted too fails such a section closed; the explicit rename/copy
# DESTINATION lines are checked as well (#668) so eligibility never rests
# solely on the header-derived split when the section carries exact paths.
#
# Omission-allowlist provenance (#668, the #636 sibling): <omit_globs> is
# read from the CURRENT CHECKOUT's .github/review-policy.yml. A PR that
# itself edits that file could broaden the allowlist (e.g. to `src/*`),
# pair it with an over-budget diff, and have this function omit
# application-code sections from the reviewer input while an APPROVED still
# posts. The #628 trusted-path rule (orchestrator runs from a trusted
# main-ref checkout) mitigates that only operationally; the mechanical
# guard is here: when omission is needed (the diff is over budget) and ANY
# section touches $P4B_REVIEW_POLICY_REPO_PATH on any side, this function
# refuses omission entirely and returns non-zero, so the run falls back to
# the manual handoff instead of trusting an allowlist the PR under review
# may have rewritten. Under-budget diffs are unaffected — they pass through
# verbatim and the allowlist plays no role. The trust argument mirrors the
# #429 head-pinned exemption: only inputs the PR author cannot influence
# may decide what the reviewer never sees.
# Shared awk function that recovers the b/-side (new) path from a `diff --git`
# header, used by BOTH awk passes in p4b_trim_review_diff so the omit decision
# and the omission-placeholder disclosure key off an identical path (#697).
#
# For a RENAME/COPY the section carries an explicit `rename to`/`copy to` line,
# and THAT is the authoritative new path — the header split is only a heuristic.
# So when the caller knows the destination (rto non-empty) it is returned
# verbatim; the header is never re-parsed for renames/copies (#712). This also
# closes the mis-split where a crafted rename header (a != b) whose concatenated
# "A b/B" text happens to contain an earlier SYMMETRIC " b/" split — e.g.
# `diff --git a/data/a b/data/a b/data/a b/data/a` renaming `data/a b/data/a
# b/data/a` to `data/a` — would otherwise return the synthetic midpoint instead
# of the real b-side.
#
# For a plain EDIT header `diff --git a/P b/P` no rto exists (rto empty): the
# a/- and b/-sides are equal, so the real b-path is the value V for which the
# remainder after stripping the leading "a/" is exactly "V b/V". This is
# recovered even when V itself contains the literal " b/" (e.g. P = `foo b/bar`),
# which a bare greedy `sub(/^diff --git a\/.* b\//, "", p)` mis-splits. If no
# symmetric split exists (a modeless header with a != b and no rto — e.g. a mode
# change with differing sides, which the pre-#712 code also handled greedily) it
# falls back to the greedy last-" b/" tail.
