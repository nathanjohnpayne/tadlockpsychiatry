# `scripts/phase-4b/` — automated Phase 4b review handoff

Reference implementation for automating the Phase 4b external-review
handoff (REVIEW_POLICY.md § Phase 4b). Design and diagrams:
[`plans/automated-phase-4b-handoff.md`](../../plans/automated-phase-4b-handoff.md).

This started as a disabled reference implementation: runnable, fail-closed,
unit-tested with fake CLIs, and accompanied by real plan-backed `codex` /
`claude` validation evidence in PR #580's review thread. **Mergepath itself
runs it ENABLED since 2026-07-02 (#628: `phase_4b_automation.enabled: true`,
accounting live; `high` effort on both adapters since #669, with xhigh as
the per-run, per-adapter env escalation)** — the bootstrap template
mirror resets the switch to `false`, so any OTHER repo still opts in
explicitly and should re-run the live adapter validation from its own
enablement environment before flipping `phase_4b_automation.enabled: true`.
Invocation and the trusted-path rule (run from a main-ref checkout, never
the PR-under-review's checkout) live in REVIEW_POLICY.md and AGENTS.md; the
checkout's on-disk location follows `docs/agents/worktree-placement.md`.

## Components

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| [`../phase-4b-review.sh`](../phase-4b-review.sh) | Orchestrator. Selects the reviewer (≠ author), dispatches to an adapter, fails closed on any doubt, and posts the verdict under the reviewer PAT via `gh-as-reviewer.sh`. |
| [`adapters/review-via-codex.sh`](adapters/review-via-codex.sh) | Direction A (Claude→Codex). `codex --ask-for-approval never exec --sandbox read-only --output-schema verdict.schema.json`. |
| [`adapters/review-via-claude.sh`](adapters/review-via-claude.sh) | Direction B (Codex→Claude). `claude -p --system-prompt ... --permission-mode plan --effort medium --tools "" --output-format json`. |
| [`verdict.schema.json`](verdict.schema.json) | The normalized verdict contract both adapters emit, with optional adapter-populated token usage metadata when the CLI exposes it. **Single source of truth for the structural contract** — the `lib.sh` validator derives its key sets and enums from this file (see below). |
| [`lib.sh`](lib.sh) | Shared config readers, reviewer selection, `jq`-based verdict validation, JSON-block extraction, and the per-adapter timeout/effort resolvers. |
| [`collect-enablement-evidence.sh`](collect-enablement-evidence.sh) | Captures the pre-enablement evidence (#586): CLI versions, plan-auth status, API-key env scan, resolved config, and an optional adapter dry-run. Markdown or `--json`; exits `1` when BLOCKED. |
| [`accounting.sh`](accounting.sh) | Approval-loop accounting (#602). Sourced by the orchestrator; renders the "## Phase 4b Approval Accounting" block + embedded `p4b-accounting:v1` record into the automated `APPROVED` review body. Pure functions, no network; advisory to safety (any failure ⇒ the plain summary posts). |
| [`accounting.schema.json`](accounting.schema.json) | JSON Schema for the embedded `p4b-accounting/v1` record; the golden #580 sample is validated against it in `tests/test_phase_4b_accounting.sh`. |
| [`prices.json`](prices.json) | Versioned public-list-price table (#604) for the accounting's **notional** (not-billed) cost figures; every record stamps the `price_table_version` it used. |

### Verdict contract: drift resistance & extraction

- **Schema-derived validation (#585).** `p4b_validate_verdict` no longer
  hand-mirrors the verdict's structural constants. It reads the top-level key
  set, the `verdict` enum, the per-finding key set, the `severity` enum, and
  the `usage` key set **from `verdict.schema.json` at validation time**, so
  editing the schema reconfigures the validator automatically — the two cannot
  silently drift. Only the semantics the JSON Schema cannot express stay in
  `jq`: the config-dependent `feedback_policy` approval gate, the
  all-or-nothing `usage` object, and the 1-based `line` bound. A missing or
  malformed schema makes validation fail closed. `tests/test_phase_4b_automation.sh`
  adds behavior-locking parity fixtures (`tests/fixtures/phase_4b_verdicts.jsonl`),
  schema-vs-validator boundary assertions, and — when a JSON Schema validator
  (`check-jsonschema`/`ajv`) is installed — an independent cross-check that every
  validator-accepted fixture is also schema-valid.
- **Hardened JSON extraction (#587).** `p4b_extract_json_block` (used by the
  Claude adapter to pull the verdict out of model output) is a string-aware
  brace-depth scanner rather than a naive first-`{`-to-last-`}` slice. It tracks
  JSON string literals (honoring `\"` / `\\` escapes) so braces inside string
  values don't miscount, and it stops at the matching close of the **first**
  balanced object — so balanced-brace prose *after* the JSON object can no
  longer extend the slice and corrupt it. Unbalanced or object-free input emits
  nothing, so schema validation still fails closed on ambiguous output.

### Approval-loop accounting (#602)

When `phase_4b_automation.accounting.enabled` is not `false` (the default is
`true`; with mergepath's parent switch now on, the block is live — on a repo
whose parent `enabled` is false it still gates everything), the
orchestrator sources `accounting.sh` and:

1. **Records every loop.** Each invocation appends one loop record to a
   per-PR loop log under `.mergepath/phase-4b-loops/` (gitignored runtime
   state; override with `P4B_ACCT_STATE_DIR`) — including CHANGES_REQUESTED
   rounds and fail-closed fallbacks (reason + duration, counted as positive
   safety evidence), so a changes-requested-then-fixed cycle renders its full
   history.
2. **Augments the APPROVED body.** On an approval it appends the
   "## Phase 4b Approval Accounting" block — loop table, findings lifecycle
   with dispositions, a rigor proof-of-work table (rows are green only when
   the backing signal was captured; otherwise `n/a — reason`), the four-part
   cost model (wall-clock / CLI-exposed tokens / throttle / labeled
   **notional** $ with billed `$0.00` on the plan; a CLI-REPORTED cost —
   Claude envelope `total_cost_usd` → `tokens.cost_usd` /
   `totals.reported_cost_usd` — is preferred over the price-table notional,
   labeled `CLI-reported`), repo running totals with
   an explicit totals-source footer, and the embedded machine-readable
   `<!-- p4b-accounting:v1 ... -->` record (`accounting.schema.json`,
   comment-delimiter sequences inside record strings emitted as JSON
   unicode escapes so a hostile title can never close the comment early).
3. **Fails open for reporting, closed for integrity.** Any generation error ⇒
   the plain-summary approval posts unchanged (a report failure never blocks
   or fabricates an approval; exit codes are untouched). The builder and the
   renderer both refuse a record whose loop history would pair a posted
   `APPROVED` with a required-tier finding; token counts are never estimated
   (`unavailable` + source); a missing price ⇒ notional `n/a` while the record
   still posts; running-totals aggregation trouble degrades to `unavailable`
   rather than wrong numbers.

Running totals prefer an injected GitHub-derived prior-record file
(`P4B_ACCT_PRIOR_RECORDS_JSONL`, e.g. prior review bodies piped through
`p4b_acct_extract_records`); when none is injected the hook layer fetches
one itself — a single read-only `gh api graphql` call over the most
recently updated 50 merged PRs (cap via `P4B_ACCT_PRIOR_SCAN_PRS`),
plan-safe, PATH-shimmable in tests — so the real orchestrator path reports
repo-wide totals from any checkout. On fetch failure they fall back to the
append-only `.mergepath/phase-4b-ledger.jsonl` cache (two-phase commit: the record is
staged at render time and appended only after the review POST actually
succeeds, so dry-runs, head drift, and POST failures never contaminate it —
those failure paths also correct the per-PR loop log in place, so local state
never claims a phantom posted approval), else render `unavailable`. A prior
record with an unavailable (null) tokens/elapsed/notional measurement makes
that CUMULATIVE figure `unavailable` too, per metric — never coerced to 0. Notional pricing
requires the opt-in `accounting.{codex,claude}_price_key` mappings into
`prices.json` because the adapters do not capture exact model IDs yet.
Covered by `tests/test_phase_4b_accounting.sh` via
`scripts/ci/check_phase_4b_accounting`; design detail in
`plans/automated-phase-4b-handoff.md` § 17 and the reconciled spec
`plans/issue-602-phase-4b-accounting-SPEC.md`.

After posting an approval, the orchestrator acknowledges its exact review body when the feedback-accounting gate requires it (#1261). It uses the gate's emitted token under the selected reviewer identity and verifies the resulting accounting evidence. Optional findings already have the step-9 dispositions recorded above, and the gate’s governing base policy must still allow those dispositions. Changes-requested, unrelated, and edited bodies are not automatically acknowledged. Gradeable nonignored markers in the freeform summary lack structured step-9 evidence, so their approval body is left for acknowledgment repair. An acknowledgment failure exits `7` while reporting `review_posted: true` and `review_acknowledgment: "failed"`; repair that review's acknowledgment rather than repeating the review run.

## How it plugs in (no merge-gate changes)

The orchestrator posts an `APPROVED` review on the current HEAD under a
non-author reviewer identity. That is exactly the **Phase 4b substitute**
clearance the existing merge gate already accepts
(`scripts/codex-review-check.sh` gate (c), `codex.allow_phase_4b_substitute`,
#218), so `auto-clear-blocking-labels.yml` and `merge-clearance-gate.yml`
clear with no changes.

## Dependencies

- **Runtime:** `bash` (3.2+), `jq`, `node`, `gh`, `git`, and the reviewer CLI
  (`codex` and/or `claude`) on `PATH`. `node` runs the shared PR-body contract
  parser (`scripts/lib/pr-body-contract.mjs`), which the identity fence invokes
  on **every** enabled run — including callers that pass `--author`, which
  before #1143 skipped the body read and so never reached it. The orchestrator
  probes `node --version` beside its `jq` check, after the disabled/mode gates,
  so a host missing it gets a message naming the dependency rather than a
  parser error; the default disabled path still needs neither.
- **Reasoning-plane auth (per direction) — subscription plan only:** the
  adapters verify the persisted CLI auth mode before launch and run the
  reviewer CLI under a tightly allowlisted child environment. Codex must report
  `auth_mode=chatgpt`; Claude must report `apiProvider=firstParty` with either
  `authMethod=claude.ai` plus a `subscriptionType`, or
  `authMethod=oauth_token` for a headless Claude Code subscription token.
  Reasoning therefore bills against the operator's **individual plan**, never
  the metered API. API-key env vars, GitHub tokens, deploy/cloud credentials,
  and SSH-agent state are not inherited by the child CLI.
  Log in once per direction: Codex via `codex login` (ChatGPT account);
  Claude via its subscription login or `claude setup-token`
  (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, which is preserved). If the CLI is not
  plan-logged-in, the read-only call fails and the orchestrator falls back to
  the manual handoff (fail-closed) — it never uses the API.
- **Child-process credential isolation:** the reviewer CLI child process is
  launched with an allowlisted environment (`PATH`, `HOME`, locale/tmp basics,
  plus `CODEX_HOME` or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` only when needed). It does not
  inherit GitHub tokens, pay-per-token API keys, deploy/cloud credentials, or
  SSH agent state from the parent session. Only the parent orchestrator keeps
  the reviewer PAT, and only for the final `gh-as-reviewer.sh` write after the
  head SHA is re-read. The write uses the pull-review API with `commit_id` set
  to the reviewed SHA and verifies the created review response is pinned to
  that SHA.
- **Tool/file-access isolation:** Codex runs from an empty scratch review root
  with scratch `HOME`/`CODEX_HOME`; the copied Codex auth file lives outside the
  review root. Claude runs with a compact structured-output prompt, a
  text-only system prompt, `--effort medium`, `--tools ""`, `--safe-mode`,
  disabled slash commands, and no session persistence. The diff is supplied on
  stdin in both directions, so neither reviewer needs repo or home-directory
  read tools.
- **Timeouts + effort (configurable, #589):** the reviewer CLI timeout and
  effort are read per-adapter from `phase_4b_automation` so Codex and Claude can
  be tuned without editing the adapter scripts. The orchestrator resolves them
  (`p4b_resolve_adapter_timeout` / `p4b_resolve_adapter_effort`) and passes them
  down via `P4B_REVIEW_CLI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `P4B_{CLAUDE,CODEX}_EFFORT`.
  - **Timeout:** `adapter_timeout_seconds` (shared) with optional
    `codex_timeout_seconds` / `claude_timeout_seconds` overrides. Must be an
    integer in `[1, 3600]`; absent ⇒ `900`. A non-integer or out-of-range value
    is rejected **fail-closed** (the orchestrator exits `3`) so a typo can never
    effectively unbound the CLI. `P4B_ADAPTER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` /
    `P4B_REVIEW_CLI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` still override at runtime for tests/manual
    runs. A timeout exits through the same fail-closed manual-handoff path as any
    other adapter error.
  - **Effort:** `claude_effort` (`low|medium|high|xhigh|max`, default `medium`,
    → `claude --effort`) and `codex_effort` (`minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh`,
    `xhigh` model-dependent, default empty = Codex CLI default, → `codex -c
    model_reasoning_effort`, validated against codex-cli 0.137; `--strict-config`
    is not used, so an unrecognized key on a future CLI is a harmless no-op). An
    invalid value is rejected fail-closed.
- **Review metadata:** posted reviews include reviewed head SHA, reviewer
  identity, adapter, adapter run count, timeout, token usage when exposed by
  the CLI, and an explicit `not exposed` marker for model-internal turn count.
  CLI token counters are best-effort because reviewer CLI stderr/envelope
  formats can change; when parsing fails the adapters safely emit `usage: null`.
- **Feedback-policy approval gate:** the verdict validator reads
  `feedback_policy` when present (#574). `APPROVED` may not carry findings in
  any policy-required severity tier; absent `feedback_policy` defaults to
  P0/P1 required and P2/P3 discretionary. `mode: address-all` makes every
  finding block an automated approval. Separately, an `APPROVED` verdict that
  carries discretionary findings triggers the policy step-9 executor (#672):
  the orchestrator files one `post-review` + `observation` issue per finding
  (author identity, assigned to it) and posts the approval with the issue
  references appended — observations become issues BEFORE the approval clears
  the merge gate. Any filing failure refuses the approval fail-closed (the
  pre-#672 behavior); `phase_4b_automation.post_review_issues: false` opts a
  repo back into the plain refusal.
- **Attribution-plane auth:** the selected reviewer's PAT is resolved through
  `scripts/gh-as-reviewer.sh`. The orchestrator sets
  `GH_AS_REVIEWER_IDENTITY` and deliberately clears a stale
  `OP_PREFLIGHT_REVIEWER_PAT` from the authoring agent session before the
  wrapper runs, so the wrapper verifies the selected reviewer identity instead
  of hard-failing on the current agent's cached reviewer PAT.
- **Config:** the `phase_4b_automation:` block in
  `.github/review-policy.yml` (ships **disabled**, so behavior is unchanged
  until a repo opts in).

## Enabling

Before flipping the switch, capture the enablement evidence (#586) from the
environment that will post reviews, on plan auth, with no API-key env vars set:

```bash
# Markdown for a PR comment, or --json for machine checks. Exits 1 if BLOCKED
# (an API key is set, or no direction has a plan-authed CLI). Add
# --diff-file <patch> (or --pr N --repo owner/repo) to include a live dry-run.
scripts/phase-4b/collect-enablement-evidence.sh
```

It records `codex --version` / `claude --version`, each adapter's plan-auth
status, the disallowed-API-key scan, the resolved per-adapter timeout/effort,
and (optionally) a successful adapter dry-run — the exact evidence the
enablement PR should paste. Then flip the switch:

```yaml
# .github/review-policy.yml
phase_4b_automation:
  enabled: true
  mode: local
```

While disabled (default), `phase-4b-review.sh` exits `5` and the caller
uses today's manual handoff (`post-phase-4b-handoff.sh`). The handoff renderer
runs complete-history feedback accounting before emitting the reviewer prompt;
it exits `4` with no handoff when an earlier finding is unaccounted (#1000).
Automated-mode fallbacks run that accounting before announcing or rendering a manual handoff; a miss becomes orchestrator exit `7`, not fallback exit `4`.

`max_review_rounds` is a declarative cap for the outer review flow. This
reference helper performs one exhaustive adapter pass per invocation; callers
that re-run it after `CHANGES_REQUESTED` own round counting and escalation.

## Try it (dry-run, offline, with fake CLIs)

Save this as a file and run it (`bash try-it.sh`) rather than pasting it into a
shell — it uses strict mode and exits on failure by design.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# A recipe whose whole claim is "offline" has to FAIL CLOSED when its offline
# setup fails. Without the strict-mode preamble, a failed `mkdir`/`cat`/`chmod`
# below would leave PATH pointing at a directory that does not exist, the real
# `gh` would resolve, and the run would quietly perform a LIVE PR-body read.
set -euo pipefail

# The identity fence reads the PR body from the API on every run (#1143), so
# an offline recipe has to serve one. This fake `gh` answers the body read and
# returns a fixed head for everything else; nothing leaves the machine.
# A private mktemp -d, not a predictable /tmp path: a leftover from an earlier
# run, or another user's file at the same name, is exactly how the setup fails.
P4B_OFFLINE="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/p4b-offline.XXXXXX")"
trap 'rm -rf "$P4B_OFFLINE"' EXIT
mkdir -p "$P4B_OFFLINE/bin"
cat > "$P4B_OFFLINE/bin/gh" <<'SH'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
for a in "$@"; do
  case "$a" in
    *'.body'*) printf 'Authoring-Agent: claude\n\n## Self-Review\n\n- ok.\n'; exit 0 ;;
  esac
done
printf 'deadbeef\n'
SH
chmod +x "$P4B_OFFLINE/bin/gh"
export PATH="$P4B_OFFLINE/bin:$PATH"

# Verify rather than assume. Strict mode catches a setup step that RETURNS
# non-zero; it does not catch one that succeeds into the wrong state (a fake
# written but left non-executable, a PATH that does not contain it). Proving
# which `gh` resolves covers both, and is the only check that actually states
# the guarantee this recipe makes.
[ "$(command -v gh)" = "$P4B_OFFLINE/bin/gh" ] || {
  echo "offline setup failed; refusing to run against the real gh" >&2
  exit 1
}

printf 'verdict' > "$P4B_OFFLINE/diff.txt"
CODEX_BIN=/path/to/fake-codex \
  MERGEPATH_REVIEW_FEEDBACK_ACCOUNTING_CMD=true \
  scripts/phase-4b-review.sh 123 --repo nathanjohnpayne/mergepath \
    --author claude --head deadbeef --diff-file "$P4B_OFFLINE/diff.txt" --dry-run
```

`--dry-run` reads and validates the PR body, then performs selection + adapter
dispatch + verdict validation, and prints the intended action without posting.
Its final JSON adds `validated_verdict` only for a dry run: the complete,
schema-validated adapter verdict, including its summary, findings, and
normalized usage. This lets a caller classify the result before any publisher
acts. Real-run JSON retains its existing summary shape and never includes this
field.
The offline recipe explicitly replaces the live review-feedback accounting read
with `true`; real dry-runs keep that gate enabled so they cannot spend a
reviewer round while older feedback is unaccounted. Adapter CLIs are injectable
via `CODEX_BIN` / `CLAUDE_BIN`, which is how
`tests/test_phase_4b_automation.sh` exercises the package without network or
real model calls.

This recipe fakes `gh` and the reviewer CLI and nothing else. In particular it
needs a **real** `node`, because the identity fence runs the shared contract
parser under it. That is deliberate: `gh` is faked because it is the network
boundary, and the point of faking it is to keep the run offline. `node` is a
local execution dependency — the parser reads stdin and writes stdout, reaching
nothing — so faking it would remove the real contract check the recipe exists to
exercise, and would make a dry-run rehearse a different program than a real run.
`jq` and `bash` are real here for the same reason.

`--author` is a cross-check, not an override (#1143): it must name the same
agent the body declares, so the fake above serves `claude` to match the
`--author claude` in the command. Change one and you must change the other, or
the run refuses with exit `3` — which is the flag behaving as designed rather
than the recipe being broken. Dropping `--author` entirely also works; the body
is what supplies the identity.

The #814 same-head barrier is **skipped** under `--dry-run`, which is part of
what keeps this recipe offline. The barrier guards the review POST and a
dry-run never posts, so there is no ordering hazard for it to prevent — and
both provider probes it would otherwise run are `gh`-backed, so running them
would require network and credentials here. A real run always evaluates it.
The identity fence is `gh`-backed too and is **not** skipped on a dry-run,
which is why this recipe injects a fake `gh` rather than relying on the
orchestrator needing none: reading the body is the point of that fence, and a
dry-run that skipped it would rehearse a different program than the real one.

For Codex, “no current-head signal” is not sufficient to open the barrier: it ordinarily remains `not-yet`. The #1085 exception is a durable Phase 4a timeout determination written by `codex-review-request.sh` to the PR timeline after a confirmed author-owned trigger exhausts its bounded wait. The marker is versioned, pinned to the full head SHA, bound to that trigger comment, and trusted only from `author_identity`; it remains current only while that trigger is the latest exact author-owned `@codex review` request in the complete timeline. A newer exact request supersedes the old timeout and keeps Phase 4b pending until that new attempt reaches its own terminal result. The full provider barrier runs before the adapter. After the adapter returns schema-valid output, the orchestrator re-reads the paginated timeline and live head before interpreting the verdict or performing its first approval-side effect, then repeats that targeted timeout-generation read immediately before the review POST; the final read corrects provisional accounting and closes this run's filed follow-ups before holding or falling back. A request arriving during either external-review window therefore cannot inherit an older waiver. Stale markers remain pending, while malformed/unreadable evidence and head drift escalate fail-closed. Provider-authored usage-limit/not-connected comments make `codex-review-request.sh` exit `4` with `blocked_reason`; the later `codex-review-check.sh --diagnostic-signal-only` probe maps that evidence to its separate exit-`2` Phase 4b waiver.

## Identity fences (#1143)

The PR body is the record of authorship, and the orchestrator reads and
validates it against the shared contract (`scripts/lib/pr-body-contract.sh`) on
**every** run — the same contract the required Self-Review gate enforces.
`--author` is a cross-check against the `Authoring-Agent:` the body declares,
never an override: a disagreement exits `3`, and there is no opt-out.

That up-front read is not sufficient on its own, because the adapter run after
it can last the configured timeout and **editing a PR body moves no sha** — so
a mid-run identity change is invisible to every head-drift check. A body edited
to declare the agent the run picked as *reviewer* would otherwise collect a
cross-agent approval from its own authoring agent. The body and its author are
therefore revalidated at both approval-side-effect boundaries: immediately
before the step-9 issue filing, and immediately again before the review POST.

Both fences require the live body to still satisfy the contract **and** to
still declare the agent the run was planned against. A changed agent, a body
that stopped validating, and an unreadable read all refuse via
`fall_back_to_manual`; the pre-POST fence closes this run's filed follow-up
issues as superseded first, exactly as the head-drift check beside it does. An
edit that leaves the identity intact — added prose, a fixed typo — is not drift
and does not refuse.

## Exit codes (orchestrator)

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | APPROVED — review posted (or would, under `--dry-run`) |
| 1 | CHANGES_REQUESTED — posted; author addresses findings, then re-run |
| 3 | usage / infrastructure error |
| 4 | fell back to the manual handoff (adapter error, timeout, invalid verdict, head drift, or no adapter) |
| 5 | automation disabled or `mode != local` — caller uses the manual handoff |
| 6 | **held** (#814) — an enabled external provider has not reported on the reviewed head and no valid same-head terminal determination waives it. Nothing was posted and no handoff was rendered. An early hold records no loop; if a timeout generation changes only at the final pre-POST fence, its already-provisional loop is corrected to `not-posted` / fail-closed and any issues filed by that run are closed as superseded. Wait the `retry_after` seconds in the emitted JSON and re-run the same command, **from the same checkout**. Deliberately not `4`: every consumer of `4` reads it as a reviewer that will not answer, and `scripts/wave-audit.sh` proceeds fail-open on it. The wait is bounded by `coderabbit.max_wait_seconds` and escalates to `4` when exhausted — but elapsed time rides an advisory marker in `.mergepath/`, so an unwritable state dir or retries from different checkouts leave it at zero and the hold repeats without escalating. Not every hold clears by waiting either: `paused`, draft, and non-base-branch all read as not-yet and need the cause resolved. A **rate-limited** CodeRabbit is no longer a hold on its own account (#1178): the barrier cannot re-ask it and `--probe` cannot reach the polling retry, so the arm reports `coderabbit: "rate-limited"` and resolves against Codex — the barrier OPENS on a head-pinned Codex report (the run then proceeds to the adapter and exits on its verdict, so 0 or 1); HOLDS on this same exit 6 while Codex is `not-yet`, since that wait is on Codex and does clear by waiting (an exhausted bound then escalates naming the refusal, not the clock); and ESCALATES to exit 4 immediately when Codex is `waived` or disabled, because nothing has read the head. |
| 7 | **feedback unaccounted** (#1000) — an inline, top-level review-body, or PR-level finding lacks disposition evidence. Before dispatch, no adapter ran; after posting, `review_posted: true` and `review_acknowledgment: "failed"` identify an approval whose acknowledgment needs repair without repeating the review. No handoff was rendered. Complete the named dispositions; do not route this status to manual fallback. |
| 8 | **human tiebreaker required** (#1305, narrowed by #1560 slice 3): the governing Codex request ceiling is spent and a human stop holds, named in `barrier.human_stops.stops`: `blocking-budget`, `runaway`, `untested-rebuttal` or `disagreement`. A spent ceiling with no human stop waives the Codex arm and the adapter runs instead, unless `codex.allow_phase_4b_substitute` is false, which escalates to the manual handoff (exit 4). No Phase 4b handoff was rendered. Wait for an explicit human decision. |
| 10 | **request-budget authority error** (#1305) — the governing policy/timeline was unreadable, the PR head moved during cap evaluation, or an available-budget snapshot's governing PR tuple, resolved policy budget, or request generation changed or became unreadable. That snapshot is rechecked after the adapter and at the final review-publication or manual-handoff writer boundary; a late refusal corrects provisional accounting and closes this run's filed follow-up issues. No review was published and no Phase 4b handoff was rendered. Repair the read or rerun against the current head, base policy, and request timeline. |
