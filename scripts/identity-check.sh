# scripts/identity-check.sh — Pre-action identity assertion helper (#284).
#
# Asserts that the current execution context has the EXPECTED gh identity
# at the moment of call. Used as a fail-closed pre-write guard from
# helper scripts (coderabbit-wait.sh, codex-review-request.sh,
# resolve-pr-threads.sh, request-label-removal.sh) and the gh-as-*
# wrappers, so a silent active-account drift never lands a PR write
# under the wrong byline.
#
# Why this exists:
#
#   `gh` resolves the byline for write paths from the keyring's ACTIVE
#   account (read with `gh config get -h github.com user`), not from
#   GH_TOKEN. A `gh auth switch -u <X>` that silently no-ops (X not in
#   the keyring; corrupt hosts.yml; race with a parallel switch in
#   another process) leaves the keyring on the prior identity but
#   returns rc=0 — the wrapped write then lands under the wrong
#   account. See #241 / #283 for two concrete in-session incidents.
#
#   This helper is the assertion knife: one call before any write
#   verifies that the caller's expected identity matches reality.
#   Callers wire it in at the top of each WRITE path.
#
# Modes (mutually exclusive; exactly one is required):
#
#   --expect-author
#     Keyring's active account must be the author identity
#     (nathanjohnpayne by default; override via
#     IDENTITY_CHECK_EXPECTED_AUTHOR).
#
#   --expect-reviewer
#     Keyring's active account must be nathanpayne-<MERGEPATH_AGENT>.
#     MERGEPATH_AGENT is read from the environment; missing/empty
#     falls back to `claude` with a stderr warning.
#
#   --expect-external <agent>
#     Keyring's active account must be nathanpayne-<agent>. Used in
#     Phase 4b CLI sessions where the cross-agent reviewer (e.g.
#     `codex` from a `claude` parent session) needs to assert its own
#     identity before posting the external review.
#
#   --expect-token-identity <login>
#     Runs `gh api user --jq .login` with the CURRENT $GH_TOKEN and
#     asserts the response matches <login>. This is for PAT-authored
#     writes — specifically `gh api graphql` mutations like
#     resolveReviewThread, where attribution follows the token, NOT
#     the keyring. See REVIEW_POLICY.md § Operation-to-Identity Matrix.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  match (proceed)
#   1  bad invocation (no mode, conflicting modes, missing argument)
#   2  mismatch — actual identity printed with remediation hint
#   3  could not read identity (gh not installed, hosts.yml corrupt,
#      gh api user failed, etc.) — fail closed
#
# All diagnostics go to stderr; no stdout output. The script is silent
# on success so it can be dropped at the top of any helper without
# noise.
#
# IDENTITY: keyring vs PAT
#
#   `--expect-author` / `--expect-reviewer` / `--expect-external` all
#   read the KEYRING's active account via `gh config get -h github.com
#   user`. This is the GH_TOKEN-immune signal — `gh auth status` is
#   poisonable when GH_TOKEN is set (it reports the GH_TOKEN entry as
#   Active even though writes still attribute to the keyring), so we
#   never use it.
#
#   `--expect-token-identity` is the inverse: it asserts the IDENTITY
#   ATTACHED TO $GH_TOKEN, not the keyring. PAT-attributed writes
#   (specifically `gh api graphql` mutations) follow GH_TOKEN, not the
#   keyring. The matrix subsection in REVIEW_POLICY.md walks through
#   which operations belong to which auth layer.
#
# Bash 3.2 portable (macOS default).

Usage: identity-check.sh <mode>

Modes (exactly one required):
  --expect-author                   keyring active == author identity (nathanjohnpayne)
  --expect-reviewer                 keyring active == nathanpayne-$MERGEPATH_AGENT
  --expect-external <agent>         keyring active == nathanpayne-<agent>
  --expect-token-identity <login>   gh api user .login (under $GH_TOKEN) == <login>

Exit codes: 0 match | 1 bad args | 2 mismatch | 3 read failure (fail-closed).
