# scripts/codex-review-check.sh — Phase 4a merge gate
#
# Verifies that a pull request is ready to merge under the Phase 4a
# automated external review flow. Read-only. Never merges, labels, or
# comments on the PR.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/codex-review-check.sh <PR_NUMBER> [REPO]
#
# Arguments:
#   PR_NUMBER  Required. The pull request number (integer).
#   REPO       Optional. "owner/repo". Defaults to the current repo.
#
# Environment:
#   GH_TOKEN   Required. Needs pull_requests:read + checks:read.
#
# Merge gate (all three must pass):
#
#   (a) Required CI checks are green.
#       `gh pr checks` reports no failing or pending required checks.
#
#   (b) At least one APPROVED review from a reviewer identity in
#       codex.available_reviewers (e.g., nathanpayne-claude,
#       nathanpayne-cursor, nathanpayne-codex) is present on the PR,
#       from an account != the PR author.
#
#   (c) Codex has cleared on or after the current HEAD commit via one
#       of two signals:
#
#         - A COMMENTED review from the Codex bot on the current HEAD
#           with NO unaddressed P0/P1 inline findings, OR
#         - A +1 / 👍 reaction from the Codex bot on the PR issue
#           with created_at >= current HEAD committer date.
#
#       The merge gate explicitly does NOT require an APPROVED review
#       state from the Codex bot. The ChatGPT Codex Connector GitHub
#       App never emits APPROVED — it uses COMMENTED with inline
#       findings, or no review at all when it reacts 👍. See #29 for
#       live observational evidence from the PR #53 bootstrap.
#
# "Unaddressed" heuristic for v1:
#   A P0/P1 finding is considered unaddressed if it exists on the
#   current HEAD (original_commit_id == HEAD or commit_id == HEAD) in
#   Codex's LATEST review round. Findings from earlier rounds that
#   are not re-raised by Codex on the current HEAD are considered
#   implicitly addressed — the agent either fixed them or Codex
#   accepted a rebuttal. This is the simpler end of the two options
#   discussed in the #35 refinement; see #35 comment thread for the
#   reply-matching version if false-negatives become a problem.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   All three gate conditions pass; PR is mergeable.
#   1   At least one gate condition fails. A one-line reason is
#       printed to stderr.
#   3   API / infrastructure error. Error message on stderr.
#
# Design notes:
#   - Read-only. The only API calls are GETs: pulls, reviews, comments,
#     reactions, commits, checks. No POSTs, no PATCHes, no DELETEs.
#   - Uses jq for all JSON parsing. No ad-hoc string extraction.
#   - The available_reviewers list is read from .github/review-policy.yml
#     at runtime via the same state-machine awk parser used in
#     agent-review.yml post-#54.

# HEAD_PUSHED_AT: the timestamp to use as the "when did this commit
# become current on THIS PR" anchor for reaction freshness. Committer
# date is commit metadata and can be ARBITRARILY OLD if someone force-
# pushes a previously-authored commit — a stale Codex 👍 from a prior
# HEAD would then satisfy `reaction.created_at >= committer_date` even
# though the reaction predates the current HEAD's existence on this
# PR. See #64 Codex P1 finding ("Anchor reaction freshness to PR head
# update time") and the #65 round-1/2/3 follow-up findings.
#
# Iteration history and why the obvious fixes don't work:
#
#   Round 1 tried `repos/{repo}/commits/{sha}/check-runs`. Rejected:
#   that endpoint is COMMIT-scoped, not PR-scoped — if the same SHA
#   ran in an earlier context (different branch, previous PR, direct
#   push to main), the earliest check-run's started_at comes from
#   THAT context and leaks across PRs.
#
#   Round 2 tried `repos/{repo}/issues/{pr}/timeline` with a
#   `head_ref_force_pushed` event selector. Better: that endpoint is
#   strictly PR-scoped. BUT it only covers force-push. For ORDINARY
#   push / fast-forward to a descendant commit, the timeline emits a
#   `committed` event whose `created_at` is `null` — verified against
#   PR #63's raw timeline payload on 2026-04-15. There is no per-PR
#   push timestamp for non-force pushes in the GitHub API.
#
# The ordinary-push hole:
#
#   Scenario — PR HEAD is at commit A, Codex reacts 👍 on the PR at
#   time T1, then the PR is advanced via ordinary push (fast-forward)
#   to descendant commit B whose committer date is OLDER than T1
#   (e.g., cherry-pick of a pre-existing SHA, or a commit authored
#   weeks ago and just now pushed). The stale 👍 from HEAD A would
#   pass `reaction.created_at >= HEAD_COMMITTER_DATE` on HEAD B and
#   false-clear gate (c) because the anchor can only be advanced by a
#   signal we don't have access to.
#
# Two-layer mitigation applied below:
#
#   Layer 1 — per-PR push anchor via force-push events. For the cases
#   where a per-PR push time IS observable (force-push), use it.
#   Start with HEAD_COMMITTER_DATE as the base (correct for the
#   common case where committer date ≈ push time), then override to
#   `head_ref_force_pushed.created_at` if later. This closes the
#   force-push-of-old-commit variant identified in the #64 review.
#
#   Layer 2 — reaction freshness floor. Bound the exposure window of
#   the residual ordinary-push-old-committer-date hole by requiring a
#   👍 reaction to be within `codex.reaction_freshness_window_seconds`
#   of the gate-check time. A stale 👍 from a prior HEAD that outlives
#   the window is automatically filtered out, regardless of how old
#   the new HEAD's committer date is. Default 1800s (30 min) is
#   generous for the typical Phase 4a cycle (1–5 min push → clearance)
#   while catching cross-cycle stale 👍s. See review-policy.yml
#   `codex.reaction_freshness_window_seconds` for the full rationale.
#
# Residual hole: if the stale 👍 is within the freshness window AND
# the new HEAD was pushed via ordinary push AND the new HEAD has an
# old committer date, a false clear is still mechanically possible.
# That combination is narrow — it requires a rebased/cherry-picked
# old commit pushed within the freshness window after a prior-HEAD
# 👍. Closing it fully would require a per-PR push timestamp that
# GitHub does not currently expose.

# stale thumbs-up when newer Codex findings exist").
#
# Semantics: Codex sends either a review OR a 👍 reaction per pass, but
# on a PR with multiple rounds on the same HEAD it can end up with both
# historical review comments AND a reaction. The LATEST one wins:
#
#   - If Codex's most recent signal is a review, inspect its P0/P1
#     findings. Zero findings → clear. Any findings → block.
#   - If Codex's most recent signal is a 👍 reaction, clear. Codex only
#     reacts 👍 when it has no suggestions, so a newer 👍 overrides any
#     earlier review's findings.
#   - If both timestamps exist, use max() to pick the latest.
#   - If neither exists, block.
#
# All review-side analysis still uses the latest review's
# pull_request_review_id to scope findings (addressed in round 1's
# finding 2), so an older review's stale comments are never counted.
