## Code Review Policy

This repository uses a multi-identity AI agent code review system. The full policy is in REVIEW_POLICY.md. The per-repo configuration is in .github/review-policy.yml.

### Identity Rules

- All agents author and commit code as nathanjohnpayne.
- Each agent reviews code under its own reviewer identity (e.g., nathanpayne-claude, nathanpayne-cursor, nathanpayne-codex).
- An agent never reviews code under the same identity that authored it.
- Only nathanjohnpayne merges to the target branch.

### Workflow Summary

0. Run credential preflight at the start of every PR session (and safely
   at the top of every subsequent tool call — re-running within the TTL
   returns cached values without a new biometric prompt):
   `eval "$(scripts/op-preflight.sh --agent {your-agent} --mode all)"`
   This triggers biometric prompts once and writes a chmod-600 session
   file at `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mergepath/op-preflight-<agent>.env` so fresh
   subshells can reuse the credentials (see REVIEW_POLICY.md § Phase 0).
   Use `GH_TOKEN="$OP_PREFLIGHT_REVIEWER_PAT"` for reviewer commands and
   `GH_TOKEN="$OP_PREFLIGHT_AUTHOR_PAT"` for author commands.
   Run `scripts/op-preflight.sh --agent {your-agent} --purge` (or
   `--purge-all`) at end of session to delete the cached PATs.
1. Author code as nathanjohnpayne. File a PR.
2. Switch to your reviewer identity (e.g., nathanpayne-claude). Review the PR. Post comments.
3. Switch back to nathanjohnpayne. Address each comment. Push fix commits.
4. Repeat steps 2–3 until the reviewer identity approves with no outstanding issues.
5. If this repo has `coderabbit.enabled: true` in `.github/review-policy.yml`:
   a. **Wait** for CodeRabbit to post its review on the current HEAD. Prefer `scripts/coderabbit-wait.sh <PR#>` over an ad-hoc poll — it anchors "cleared" on the HEAD committer date (closing the race that let auto-merge fire pre-CodeRabbit; see #136) and handles CodeRabbit's non-auto-retrying rate-limit state by parsing the published window and posting `@coderabbitai, try again.` itself (see #138). Exit codes: `0` cleared, `2` findings, `4` grace-window timeout (advisory — log and skip), `5` rate-limit stalled (alert the human, do not proceed).
   b. **Read both endpoints:** PR-level comments (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pr}/comments`) and inline diff comments (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments`).
   c. **Grep inline comments** for `Potential issue` or `⚠️` — these must each be explicitly addressed (fixed or dismissed with reasoning).
   d. Address other substantive findings. CodeRabbit review is advisory and does not block merge.
6. Check .github/review-policy.yml for the external review threshold. If the PR does NOT meet it (lines changed < external_review_threshold AND no file matches external_review_paths), merge as nathanjohnpayne. Done.
7. If the PR meets the threshold, proceed to Phase 4 (see REVIEW_POLICY.md § Phase 4). Phase 4 has two legs:
   - **Phase 4a — Automated (preferred)** when ALL of: `codex.enabled: true` in `.github/review-policy.yml`, BOTH `scripts/codex-review-request.sh` AND `scripts/codex-review-check.sh` exist on disk, AND the **ChatGPT Codex Connector GitHub App is review-ready on this repo**. "Review-ready" means installed, Code Review enabled at [chatgpt.com/codex/cloud/settings/code-review](https://chatgpt.com/codex/cloud/settings/code-review), AND a Codex environment configured at [chatgpt.com/codex/cloud/settings/environments](https://chatgpt.com/codex/cloud/settings/environments). Verify only by observation: did a recent PR in this repo receive an auto-review from `chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`? That is the only reliable check from a reviewer PAT — `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/installation` requires a GitHub App JWT and returns 401 for normal tokens. Drive the Codex GitHub App review loop: post `@codex review` via the request script, address **P0/P1** findings (fix code or rebuttal reply — P2/P3 findings do NOT block clearance), loop up to `codex.max_review_rounds`. On clearance (COMMENTED review with no unaddressed P0/P1 findings on the current HEAD, OR 👍 reaction from `chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`), run `scripts/codex-review-check.sh` to verify the merge gate and merge. On exit code 4 (timeout), drop to Phase 4b. On repeat-after-rebuttal or round > `max_review_rounds`, escalate per § Disagreements below. If any of the conditions is false (Codex App not review-ready, partial script rollout, or Codex disabled in config), fall back to Phase 4b directly rather than entering 4a and stalling.
   - **Phase 4b — Manual CLI fallback** when 4a is unavailable or 4a fell back. Post the handoff message (see REVIEW_POLICY.md § Handoff Message Format) and wait for an external reviewer identity (e.g., nathanpayne-codex) to post an `APPROVED` review via a separate agent CLI session. Address feedback via back-and-forth.
8. If the external reviewer flags observations or risks while approving, create a GitHub Issue for each one assigned to nathanjohnpayne with labels "post-review" and "observation" or "risk" before merging.
9. Merge as nathanjohnpayne.

### Disagreements

If the internal reviewer and external reviewer disagree on whether code is ready to merge, the human is the tiebreaker. Surface both positions clearly and wait.

In Phase 4a specifically, the agent escalates automatically on either of two signals: **repeat-after-rebuttal** (Codex re-flags a finding after the agent posted a rebuttal reply) or **runaway rounds** (round counter exceeds `codex.max_review_rounds`, default 2). On escalation, the agent stops the loop, posts a comment on the PR summarizing both positions with links to the review rounds, alerts the human, and does not merge. Timeout (exit code `4` from `codex-review-request.sh`) is NOT a disagreement — it falls back to Phase 4b directly. Full detail in REVIEW_POLICY.md § Disagreements and Tiebreaking.

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create a GitHub account: nathanpayne-{agent}
2. Add it to available_reviewers in .github/review-policy.yml.
3. Configure the agent environment with credentials for both nathanjohnpayne and the new reviewer identity.

For the complete policy including the handoff message format, post-merge issue creation rules, and git identity switching instructions, read REVIEW_POLICY.md.
