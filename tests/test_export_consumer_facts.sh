#
# Regression-guard for the yq filter inside
# scripts/sync-to-downstream.sh's `export_consumer_facts()`. The
# initial Phase B2 (#316) implementation used a mikefarah/yq-
# incompatible `if (tag == "!!seq") then ... else ... end` form
# that silently emitted nothing — every templated render fell
# through to the "no frameworks" baseline because
# MERGEPATH_FACT_* was never exported. Phase D's swipewatch canary
# fell-positive on the bug because swipewatch happens to declare
# `frameworks: []` (rendered output is the same with or without
# the facts loaded). device-platform-reporting's canary surfaced
# the real failure: its `frameworks: [react]` should activate the
# React block, but rendered to the JS baseline only.
#
# This test runs the EXACT yq filter from export_consumer_facts
# against three fixture consumer profiles (seq fact, scalar fact,
# empty seq fact, no facts at all) and asserts the output shape.
# The lib's yq invocation and this test's yq invocation must stay
# in sync — both carry a "keep in sync with tests/test_export_consumer_facts.sh"
# comment for the next contributor.
#
# Bash 3.2 portable. Runs without network.
