#
# Regression test for #284 r3: helper absence MUST fail-closed.
#
# Before r3, every call site wired the identity-check helper via:
#
#   if [ "${OPT_OUT:-0}" != "1" ] && [ -x "$CHECKER" ]; then
#     "$CHECKER" --expect-reviewer || exit 2
#   fi
#
# The `[ -x "$CHECKER" ]` test sat as a co-equal precondition in the
# AND chain. If the helper was renamed, deleted, or had its +x bit
# stripped, the entire identity-check block was SILENTLY SKIPPED and
# the keyring-byline write went through without identity verification.
# This is fail-OPEN. nathanpayne-codex Phase 4b r2 on PR #293 / b0c8463
# reproduced this — a mutation reached `resolveReviewThread` without
# the gate firing.
#
# r3 restructures every wired site to fail-CLOSED:
#
#   if [ "${OPT_OUT:-0}" != "1" ]; then
#     CHECKER=".../identity-check.sh"
#     if [ ! -x "$CHECKER" ]; then
#       echo "ERROR: ... missing or non-executable: $CHECKER" >&2
#       exit 2  # (or `die 3` for scripts that use a die helper)
#     fi
#     "$CHECKER" --expect-reviewer || exit 2
#   fi
#
# This test has two parts:
#
#   Part A — Structural: grep each wired script and assert the new
#   shape is present and the old fail-open shape is gone. This is
#   what catches regression on future edits.
#
#   Part B — Behavioral: build a minimal harness that mirrors the
#   exact gate idiom from each script, run it with the helper missing,
#   absent, and present + non-executable, and assert exit 2 (or 3 for
#   die-style callers) + the required diagnostic.
#
# Bash 3.2 portable.

#
# Since #1085 the trigger is not a single greppable line: post_codex_trigger
# calls `post_author_pr_comment "@codex review" ... inline`, which builds

#      post_author_pr_comment in inline mode;

#      recording gh-as-author stub on both of its invocation branches,
#      executes exactly `-- gh pr comment <pr> --repo <repo> --body
#      '@codex review'` through the wrapper and never reaches a bare gh.
