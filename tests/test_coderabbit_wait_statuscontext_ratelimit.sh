# Regression coverage for coderabbit-wait.sh's StatusContext fast-path vs a
# rate-limited CodeRabbit (#596).
#
# CodeRabbit flips its commit StatusContext ("CodeRabbit" context) to `success`
# even when it RATE-LIMITS and performs no review — typically ~1s AFTER posting
# the rate-limit notice. With trust_status_context_for_clearance:true the
# pre-loop fast-path trusts that success. The #446 guard is supposed to suppress
# it when the latest HEAD-referencing comment is a rate_limit/paused notice, but
# it previously required the comment to be at/after the status; the 1-second
# ordering (comment@T, status@T+1) defeated that and false-cleared (exit 0) —
# the #595 dogfood that merged with no CodeRabbit review.
#
# Runs the real helper from a temp repo with stubbed gh/date/sleep and a stub
# codex-review-request.sh, so it makes no GitHub writes. Verifies:
#   1. #596: status success @T+1 + a HEAD-referencing rate-limit comment @T
#      SUPPRESSES the fast-path -> the wait keeps going, fires the Codex
#      failover, and exits 5 (rate_limit_stalled), NOT 0 (cleared).
#   2. Control: status success + a genuine review comment (class=review) on HEAD
#      still CLEARS via the fast-path (exit 0). The fix must not over-suppress.
#
# Bash 3.2 portable. Mirrors tests/test_coderabbit_wait_codex_failover.sh.

#   comment_updated_time  updated_at for the first issue comment (default:

# Codex P1 on #936, and a hazard this PR opened. summary_body_has_potential_
# issue_marker selects the newest head-anchored bot comment of ANY class. Its
# two POLL callers are safe by construction — each runs inside `case class in
# review)`, so the newest comment is already known to be a review summary and
# the helper re-picks that same comment. The StatusContext fast path added by
# this PR establishes no such precondition, so it feeds the helper an input it
# was never defined over.
#
# The fixture is the overlap where that matters. Three events on one head:
#   summary @00:00:10  a `review` comment carrying `_🟠 Major_` (the #535 class)
#   notice  @00:00:20  a rate-limit notice — newer, but NOT head-referencing
#   success @00:30:00  the StatusContext, created after both
# The #446 arbitration reads an unscoped notice CREATED BEFORE the success as
# stale and leaves the fast path unsuppressed (the `remains authoritative`
# branch — asserted below so this case cannot silently become a suppression
# test). The fast path then runs, and a class-blind pick grades the NOTICE,
# finds no badge in it, and clears — over a blocking summary two comments down
# that the polling `review` arm and `--probe` both report as findings.

# wrappers over it whose contracts are deliberately different: the strict one
# reports the infra status 3, the best-effort one reports 1, because its

# make it fatal. Sharing the algorithm must not collapse that distinction —

# step, which is why the lib reports which step failed rather than only that

# always logged the fetch wording would fail here rather than silently
# mislabel every parse failure as a transport failure.

# outran the 64 KiB pipe buffer and the marker sat near the start, the producer
# took SIGPIPE, the pipeline reported 141, and the notice fell out of
# `rate_limit` into the `review` default — the one class whose arm clears.
# Measured on the pre-fix idiom at 245894 bytes: rc 141, class `review`.
#
# The fixture is test 1's exactly, with a ~98 KiB tail appended. The #956
# current-refusal rule now decides before the older HEAD-reference grace branch,
# so the non-vacuity assertion is that the oversized body still classifies as
# `rate_limit` and enters grading-only refusal rather than the `review` default.
#
# The size sits inside a WINDOW, and both ends are asserted below. The lower
# bound is the 64 KiB pipe buffer, without which the case proves nothing. The
# upper bound is Linux's per-argument `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` — 32 pages, 131072 bytes
# — because the gh STUB hands this body to `jq --arg body`, which is an exec:
# a 200 KiB fixture passed on macOS and died on Linux CI with
# `/usr/bin/jq: Argument list too long`, turning a portability limit of the
# harness into three product-looking failures. It is the stub's marshalling
# that is bounded, not the predicate under test; the pure classifier unit in
