# --- GFM footnote definitions are containers (#1281 Phase 4b P0) ------------
# `[^x]: note` opens a container exactly as a list item does. An unindented,
# non-interrupting line after it is a genuine CommonMark lazy continuation of
# the definition's paragraph, so GitHub renders it inside the footnote -- or,
# with nothing referencing that footnote, does not render it at all. Before
# footnoteDefinition was in CONTAINERS, such a line read as a live top-level
# declaration and spoofed author identity. The parser this one replaces has the
# same hole, so this is a repair rather than a regression fix.
#
# Every expectation was verified against GitHub's renderer (POST /markdown).
# GFM table cells are containers too, and the unpiped form is the one that
# slipped: `header` / `| --- |` / a marker line puts the declaration in a
# tableCell, which GitHub renders inside a <td>. The parser being replaced
# accepts it, so this is a repair rather than a regression (Codex finding
# 4041000028). The piped form was already rejected, because the marker regex
# anchors at column one and `| Authoring-Agent:` does not match there -- it is
# pinned below so the two forms cannot drift apart.

# --- 18. workflow call sites carry the same bound (#1281) --------------------
# The 120s watchdog lives in scripts/lib/pr-body-contract.sh, so it only covers
# callers that go THROUGH that lib. Two workflows do not: reviewer assignment
# (agent-review.yml) and the weekly audit (pr-audit.yml) both execFileSync the
# generated parser directly, and both did so unbounded -- so a pathological PR
# body could stall either workflow past the bound the spec claimed. Found by the
# Phase 4b CLI reviewer at head 6556215, and it is the same defect class as the
# hook mismatch in section 17: a bound is only real where every caller honours
# it.
#
# This control ENUMERATES the direct call sites rather than checking the two
# known ones. A third site added later without a bound fails here; a control
# naming only these two files would pass while the new site stalled.
